1
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:27,110
<i>Most people
feel comfortable flying.</i>

2
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,239
<i>I would say the majority of people
have gotten accustomed</i>

3
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,158
<i>to how safe the system is.</i>

4
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,785
<i>Every day,</i>

5
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,414
<i>tens of thousands of flights,</i>

6
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,249
<i>all over the world.</i>

7
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,842
<i>There's an old saying in aviation,</i>

8
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,304
<i>"If it ain't Boeing, I ain't going."</i>

9
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,641
<i>Boeing has had such a storied history</i>

10
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:03,396
<i>and such an incredible stature
in the industry.</i>

11
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,358
<i>At any given moment,</i>

12
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>roughly 10,000 Boeing aircraft
are in service</i>

13
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,698
<i>in more than 150 countries.</i>

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,173
<i>I've reported on aviation</i>

15
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,384
<i>for more than 20 years
at </i>The Wall Street Journal.

16
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,180
Hello there. It's, uh, Andy Pasztor
from <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

17
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,682
I know that you've been asked not to talk,

18
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,768
but I'm hoping
that you can take a few minutes

19
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,270
just to answer some questions.

20
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,691
<i>By the beginning of 2018,</i>

21
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,029
<i>we'd come through the safest period
for commercial aviation</i>

22
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,948
<i>in the history of aviation.</i>

23
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,537
<i>There actually hadn't been
a big passenger jet crash</i>

24
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,747
<i>anywhere in the world the previous year.</i>

25
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,674
<i>Boeing has had so much success</i>

26
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:18,179
<i>producing incredibly safe,
reliable aircraft</i>

27
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,891
<i>that pilots and passengers
admire and love to fly on.</i>

28
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,770
<i>They had the public's trust.</i>

29
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,319
<i>And then two planes
dropped out of the sky.</i>

30
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,889
I don't remember the time.
I would say quite early in the morning.

31
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,018
It was dark, I remember.

32
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,273
My husband
prepared his flight bag,

33
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:11,858
checked his schedule,

34
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,569
checked out with his colleague
that he's flying with.

35
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,407
We had a meal
and had a chat for 20, 30 minutes.

36
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,536
That was the normal routine
before he left for his flight.

37
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,708
After he left, I went back to sleep,

38
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,629
and after a few hours,
I was expecting a call from him.

39
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,423
You know, just normal working day.

40
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:46,017
<i>Lion Inter 610
cleared for takeoff, runway 2-5 left</i>

41
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,853
Lion Inter 610
cleared for takeoff, 2-5 left.

42
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,195
- <i>V1.</i>
- Noted.

43
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,829
<i>Airspeed low.
Airspeed low.</i>

44
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,748
Indicated Airspeed Disagree,
Captain.

45
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,084
<i>Airspeed low.
Airspeed low.</i>

46
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,751
Feel Differential.

47
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,468
<i>Bank angle.
Bank angle. Bank angle.</i>

48
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,262
Altitude Disagree, Captain.

49
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,416
- <i>Lion Inter 610?
- </i>We have a flight control problem.

50
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,985
<i>Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.</i>

51
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,571
<i>Terrain. Terrain.</i>

52
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,906
Fly up! Fly up!

53
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,418
I got a call
from one of his colleagues,

54
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,170
"We are not able to find his aircraft."

55
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:00,258
I'm like, "Don't worry."
Because I knew... I... I knew my husband.

56
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,467
I knew how he flew.

57
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,387
I was just expecting a call from him.

58
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,932
You know, "I've reached."
That was the norm that we used to follow.

59
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,602
So I was expecting that call
from him instead of anyone else.

60
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,899
And after that,
it's just been... Everyone knows.

61
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:24,073
<i>Lion Air Flight 610
went missing from radar</i>

62
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,243
<i>just a few minutes
after taking off from Jakarta.</i>

63
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,124
A brand-new Boeing 737
with 189 people onboard

64
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,043
crashing moments after takeoff...

65
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,119
You mentioned
this was a... a Boeing aircraft.

66
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,812
What more do we know
about the plane, Benjamin?

67
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,357
Yeah, a Boeing, as you said,
uh, almost brand-new.

68
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,442
They had taken delivery of it
back in August.

69
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,071
It was a 737 Max.
That's the updated version of the 737.

70
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,864
They haven't been out that long.

71
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,456
That morning,

72
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,376
our families were trying
to find out information.

73
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,504
Trying to understand what was going on.

74
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,055
Very soon, everyone there
became aware of what had happened.

75
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,809
And that nobody was coming back.

76
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,694
What I was going through,
it was just pain.

77
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,531
I don't remember a thing.

78
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,535
Just except the pain,
there was nothing, purely pain.

79
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,541
To my husband,

80
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
all that mattered

81
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,130
was the safety
and security of his passengers.

82
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,470
He's flying with 188 people
along with him.

83
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,225
And the grief
that I felt for those families,

84
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,144
unbelievable.

85
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,312
Unbelievable.

86
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,660
In the first day
or two days after a crash,

87
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,538
there's really very little information
about the cause.

88
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,792
In this case,
the weather appeared to be good.

89
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,544
It was very close to the airport.

90
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,255
And this is a brand-new plane

91
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,925
built by America's
premier aircraft manufacturer.

92
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,637
And unless the black boxes
are found quickly,

93
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,222
it's all speculation.

94
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,894
Lion Air
has a spotty safety record.

95
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:02,315
Along with several Indonesian carriers,
the low-cost airline was banned

96
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,067
from flying into the United States
and Europe

97
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,861
but improved in recent years.

98
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,906
I was following the news,

99
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,033
reading each and every article,

100
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,618
anything that was online.

101
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,204
They all said the same thing.

102
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,748
They started blaming.

103
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,458
There was a blame game going on.

104
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,502
Blaming the country,

105
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,587
blaming the airline,

106
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,173
blaming the pilots,

107
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,302
saying that it was their incompetence.

108
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:36,015
The airline probably needed to do
a better job of making sure its pilots

109
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:41,229
understood exactly what to do
in case the aircraft was performing

110
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:45,483
in a unique, unusual way
and how to get out of the problem.

111
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,195
Should passengers getting
on a 737 Max be concerned?

112
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,823
I don't think so.
Certainly, in the United States,

113
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,451
they understand
how to operate this aircraft.

114
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,747
No one thought it was the airplane.

115
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,919
I am in... in print being asked
what this could possibly be and I said,

116
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,796
I would be phenomenally surprised

117
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,050
if it was related to any...
any part of the airplane's design.

118
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,469
I mean, it was a Boeing.

119
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:18,975
Everyone in the world
knew what Boeing stood for.

120
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,229
Their reputation for safety
was tremendous.

121
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,982
And at that point,

122
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,944
there really wasn't enough information
to draw any conclusions.

123
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:35,616
But then, the Indonesian investigators
found the black boxes.

124
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,746
There are two black boxes,
both of which are orange, by the way.

125
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,791
One is called a cockpit voice recorder,

126
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,794
and the other one
is called a flight data recorder.

127
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,381
It records the altitude
and the airspeed and the direction

128
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,216
and what the throttles are doing.

129
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,100
Thousands of parameters,
eight times a second,

130
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,513
so it's a very comprehensive tally
of what happened on the airplane.

131
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,311
The flight data recorder
showed that right after takeoff,

132
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,731
there was a failure of
the left-hand angle-of-attack indicator.

133
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,319
That's a sensor that's located
on either side of the airplane

134
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:15,031
that measures the angle
of the nose during flight.

135
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,911
As soon as
the faulty angle-of-attack sensors sent

136
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,372
bad data to the aircraft systems,

137
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:28,711
the stick shaker on the captain's side
would have been loudly vibrating

138
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,672
his control column
to warn of an impending stall.

139
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,883
But that was a false warning.

140
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,926
The airplane wasn't stalling.
It was flying.

141
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,848
Right away,
not only did the stick shaker go off,

142
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,976
but there was a master caution light,

143
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:48,856
airspeed disagree alerts,
and the altitude's not reading right.

144
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,736
You have this tidal wave of distraction.

145
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,615
And on top of all that,
something was putting

146
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:01,035
repeated nose-down pressure
on the airplane.

147
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,665
These pilots are fighting
and are pulling back up on the airplane

148
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,750
and trying to get it to come back up.

149
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,171
But it happens again
and drives the nose back down.

150
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,716
So they're having this oscillating battle.

151
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,762
I remember thinking,
"What's making that happen?"

152
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,852
The official response
from Boeing was,

153
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:30,773
we're looking at it, we're cooperating,
we don't know quite what happened.

154
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,276
Our sincere apologies to the families.
What you would expect.

155
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,822
Dennis Muilenburg,
who was chairman, simply said,

156
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:41,325
"Well, you know, we can't really comment
on the investigation."

157
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,746
But we found out that behind the scenes,

158
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,667
Boeing was saying that an American pilot

159
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,337
would never have gotten
into this kind of a situation

160
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:58,926
and that the Indonesian crew didn't do
everything they were supposed to do.

161
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,096
I wouldn't say it was racist,

162
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,181
but I actually remember a point

163
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,476
where they spoke
about my husband's qualifications.

164
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,672
They wanted to know
where he completed his flight training.

165
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,275
In fact, he finished
his training in the US.

166
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,614
<i>By this time,
the second week of November...</i>

167
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,159
It's Andy Pasztor
from <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

168
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,288
<i>...we began asking questions
about the design of this aircraft,</i>

169
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,874
<i>rather than the operation of the aircraft.</i>

170
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:36,172
I'm hoping to talk with you
about the 737 investigation.

171
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,424
<i>We could not understand what was going on.</i>

172
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:43,512
<i>How could a single damaged sensor
make the plane behave like this?</i>

173
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,934
Finally, Boeing
released a statement,

174
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:54,064
saying it looks like the Lion Air airplane
had an erroneous MCAS activation.

175
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,778
And all of us went, "What's an MCAS?"

176
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,907
MCAS?
I've never heard of this before.

177
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,407
What is this?

178
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:09,121
I'm looking through the manual.
It was in the abbreviation section.

179
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:14,126
How could it be in the abbreviations
but nowhere else? What is this system?

180
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,504
The MCAS,

181
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:21,258
or the Maneuvering Characteristics
Augmentation System,

182
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,722
really is just some software
connected to the angle-of-attack sensors.

183
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,601
Because of the flight characteristics
of the new Max,

184
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,522
when certain angle-of-attacks
were reached, at certain speeds,

185
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,024
the airplane tended to stall out.

186
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,488
So the MCAS was designed
to automatically push the nose back down.

187
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,949
Simple concept.

188
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,662
All they had to do was to add
a few lines of code to an existing system.

189
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,291
MCAS was designed
to work in the background,

190
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,961
using the speed trim motor

191
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,046
to swivel the horizontal stabilizer

192
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,508
just a little bit each time it sensed

193
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,553
that the angle-of-attack
was... was too high.

194
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,888
It would smoothly bring the nose down.

195
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,517
But in the case of the Lion Air crash,

196
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,228
an angle-of-attack sensor was broken,

197
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,897
which erroneously activated MCAS,

198
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,650
and it activated repeatedly.

199
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,576
Boeing said that the crew did not respond
in a way that they expected them to.

200
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,953
They didn't switch the system off.

201
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,709
The only problem was,

202
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:40,713
and everybody was
completely flummoxed and surprised

203
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,839
when they found out,

204
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:47,720
Boeing had never told pilots
that the MCAS system was on the aircraft.

205
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,016
Say what?

206
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,560
Uh, huh. Uh...

207
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,314
Yeah, I mean, that was
my response, like, "What?"

208
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,317
Um, yeah, uh...

209
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,196
How... how the heck
could this happen?

210
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:11,285
Hello there. It's Andy Pasztor
from <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

211
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,037
Is this a good time to talk?

212
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:17,207
Good. I just wanted
to follow up on our last discussion.

213
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,461
You were nice enough
to give me some time, and, uh...

214
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,880
After a lot of knocking on doors,

215
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,717
a very senior Boeing executive

216
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:31,680
told me, "We never informed
the pilots about MCAS."

217
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,099
"We never explained it to them."

218
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,518
"We never trained them on it,

219
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,356
because we didn't want
to overwhelm them with information."

220
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,402
That took my colleagues
and myself quite aback.

221
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,489
We'd never heard a senior Boeing official

222
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,075
talking along those lines.

223
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:56,330
Boeing had always prided itself
for being the pilot's advocate.

224
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,917
So we wrote a story

225
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:05,714
saying that Boeing
had proactively decided not to tell pilots

226
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,466
about the MCAS system.

227
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,427
New questions this morning for Boeing.

228
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,681
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> is reporting
that Boeing withheld information

229
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,559
on its 737 model,
according to safety experts and others...

230
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,355
As soon as it became clear
that this wasn't an oversight,

231
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,233
this wasn't just left out by accident,

232
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,859
pilots went berserk.

233
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,779
We couldn't believe it.

234
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:33,742
And once we started learning more
about this MCAS system,

235
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,453
it became our number one priority.

236
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,292
I found it disrespectful. Um,

237
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,253
every pilot I ever taught,

238
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,423
I said you want to know
as much about your airplane as possible.

239
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,975
<i>In this series
of modules,</i>

240
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,593
<i>we will discuss the differences</i>

241
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:56,098
<i>between the Boeing 737 NG
and 737 Max aircraft.</i>

242
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:01,020
<i>The 737 Max is the successor
to the 737 Next Generation...</i>

243
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,647
Facts should not be hidden
from the pilots.

244
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,026
The only training my husband was given

245
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,362
was an iPad training,
and it never mentioned MCAS.

246
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,882
<i>...improvements
similar to existing aircraft...</i>

247
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:17,661
I kept on insisting with the investigators
that this aircraft should be grounded.

248
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,457
But Boeing has
a big reputation around the world.

249
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,669
Here's what Boeing did.

250
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,672
They started contacting pilots' unions.

251
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,134
So I got a call saying
that Boeing's gonna come down

252
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,220
and brief us on this MCAS system.

253
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:39,141
This was monumental. It's the first time
high-level Boeing executives

254
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,394
have ever come to visit
the Allied Pilots Association.

255
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,483
So, on November 27th,
I met them at the door.

256
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,361
First of all,
they brought their lobbyists.

257
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,448
Who brings a lobbyist to a safety meeting?

258
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:01,413
I could see that they weren't interested
in, uh... in exchanging pleasantries,

259
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,666
so, we went into our conference room.

260
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,253
We all sat down.

261
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,674
I just assumed they were gonna bring
PowerPoint presentations,

262
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,593
graphs, charts, data.

263
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,554
And they don't have anything.

264
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,682
It's just them.

265
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,269
I could see that they were worried.

266
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,563
So I taped the meeting.

267
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,818
<i>These guys didn't even know
the damn system was on here.</i>

268
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,069
<i>Nor did anybody else.</i>

269
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,964
<i>We try not to overload
the crews with information</i>

270
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,989
<i>that's unnecessary.</i>

271
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,036
<i>I would think
there would be a priority</i>

272
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,995
<i>on explanations of things
that could kill you.</i>

273
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,748
<i>We take your point.
We really do.</i>

274
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,128
<i>Is there something being done
where Boeing might address</i>

275
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,891
<i>ways to make sure it doesn't happen again?</i>

276
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,716
<i>We're looking at relatively
straightforward software changes</i>

277
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,970
<i>that we expect we can get out
in a fairly short period of time.</i>

278
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,179
<i>Maybe six weeks.</i>

279
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,182
They've told us at that meeting,

280
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,768
they're gonna have
a software fix in six weeks.

281
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,938
Nothing gets done in six weeks.

282
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,694
So we asked, "Why don't you just ground
the airplane till you have this fix?"

283
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,906
<i>'Cause no one
has yet concluded</i>

284
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,535
<i>that the sole cause of this
was dysfunction of the airplane.</i>

285
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,705
They could have grounded
the plane,

286
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,170
but Boeing had the stature to say,
"This is a terrible thing that happened."

287
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,297
"We're working on it. Trust us."

288
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,799
Joining me
right now is the chairman,

289
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,677
president, and CEO of Boeing,
Dennis Muilenburg.

290
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,655
- Dennis, it's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

291
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,473
Thank you so much for joining us.
What can you tell us in terms of

292
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,518
what was told
to the pilots and the airlines

293
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:50,105
about any new equipment in that 737.

294
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,275
We've already issued additional bulletins
to our operators and pilots

295
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,820
around the world that point them back
to existing flight procedures

296
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,614
to handle that kind of condition.

297
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,159
The bottom line here
is the 737 Max is safe.

298
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,588
<i>Our breaking news,
an Ethiopian Airlines flight</i>

299
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,716
<i>has crashed shortly after takeoff
from Addis Ababa,</i>

300
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,345
<i>killing all 157 passengers and crew</i>

301
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,763
<i>thought to be on board.</i>

302
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,889
<i>The airline told...</i>

303
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:29,478
My wife, Nadia, she stayed up,
and at night she would listen to the BBC.

304
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,940
And the BBC said that there was just a...

305
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,484
a crash

306
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:40,489
of an airplane
that had just left Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

307
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:46,036
Our daughter, Samya,
had texted us earlier that night to say,

308
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:51,333
"I just landed in Addis.
Just a few more hours and on to Nairobi."

309
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,088
Samya had had a career in public health.

310
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,384
She had been to Africa
a couple times before.

311
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,427
You know, it's just another trip.

312
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,683
And, uh, so Nadia
woke me up and, uh, said,

313
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,144
"I think Samya was
on a plane that just crashed."

314
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,023
And I thought, "That can't be."

315
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,609
"That can't be."

316
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,117
"It can't be her flight."

317
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:30,872
And then we found out
it was... she was on Flight 302.

318
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,500
That was her plane.

319
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:41,675
Everybody else's dad, you know,
drinks alcohol, maybe smokes cigarettes.

320
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,386
My dad was addicted to tea.

321
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,973
He would have 20 cups a day.

322
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,518
He was going back to Kenya

323
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,522
because he wanted to better
the community that he grew up in.

324
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,985
He called from the airport,
and he just said, you know,

325
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,572
"Hey, Zippy, I just wanted to let you know
I'm about to board the flight."

326
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,699
It was about 8:00 p.m. at night,

327
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,577
and I remember I sat on my couch
and said, "Okay, Dad."

328
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:13,081
I just remember he said, "I love you."
And I said, you know, "I love you too."

329
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,882
The next morning, my phone was ringing,

330
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,634
and it's my brother calling.

331
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,722
And he said,
"I need you to brace yourself."

332
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:32,893
"There's a plane
that has crashed in Ethiopia,

333
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,687
and there's a high chance
that it's the flight that Dad was on."

334
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,067
And I was like,
"Dad never flew on Ethiopian Airlines,

335
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:45,447
so he definitely wasn't on that plane."
And he was like, "No, this time he did."

336
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,037
Nadia said,
"We... we have to go there."

337
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,957
So, we drove to JFK

338
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,667
and got on a plane.

339
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,344
When we got to Ethiopia, they wouldn't let
people go to the crash site.

340
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,430
So we stayed in Addis Ababa,

341
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,850
as did many other families.

342
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:20,565
It took us three days
to really verify that there just is no...

343
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,694
bodies to recover.

344
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,282
So finally they took us to the crash site.

345
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,664
There was
a few plane parts around,

346
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,167
not nearly enough
to make up a whole plane.

347
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:45,924
There were personal things
strewn all around the crash site.

348
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,761
Some clothes that were fluttering about.

349
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,555
Some papers fluttering about.

350
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,268
And there was a hole.

351
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,772
The plane went 500, 600 miles an hour

352
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,900
straight into the...
straight into the ground.

353
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,991
I saw people gathered
about the crater looking down.

354
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,536
Some brought flowers.

355
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:21,042
Nadia had brought flowers,
roses for Samya Rose and threw them...

356
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,505
threw them in.

357
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,231
Just the idea that a plane
within five months, the same plane,

358
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:47,486
a <i>new</i> plane went down
in eerily similar circumstances,

359
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,616
close to the airport,
relatively low altitude, not bad weather.

360
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:57,287
All the obvious reasons
that planes would... would... would crash.

361
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,332
Boeing faces a lot
of safety questions this morning

362
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:04,044
because this is the second crash
in just five months involving

363
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,338
their best-selling passenger jet.

364
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,382
Major US carriers use this new aircraft.

365
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,260
Hundreds are in service,
thousands are on order,

366
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,805
and there are calls
this morning to ground all of them.

367
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,850
Two crashes
of brand-new airplanes

368
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,727
within five months of each other.

369
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,314
That doesn't happen in modern aviation.

370
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,651
But Boeing would not publicly consider

371
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,904
that something was... was wrong
with the design of the airplane.

372
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,949
There are a lot of passengers
who are afraid of the Max.

373
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,451
Again, our commitment
to safety is unwavering,

374
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,079
and, uh, we do regret
the impact that this has had...

375
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,832
Safety is at the core
of who we are at Boeing.

376
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,211
And ensuring safe
and reliable travel on our airplanes...

377
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:50,006
The statement coming from Boeing,
"Safety is Boeing's number one priority."

378
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,051
"We have full confidence
in the safety of the Max."

379
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:56,972
"It is also important to note
that the Federal Aviation Administration

380
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,725
is not mandating
any further action at this time."

381
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,060
The FAA,

382
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,480
the Federal Aviation Administration,

383
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,692
who's in charge
of aviation safety in the US,

384
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,403
had the power to ground the aircraft.

385
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,740
The FAA said
it was waiting for data,

386
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,410
and until we have that data,

387
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,204
making a decision would be premature.

388
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,874
So they didn't make
a decision one way or the other.

389
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:31,756
The day after the crash,
the Chinese absolutely floored everyone

390
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,427
when they, on their own,
unilaterally ground this aircraft.

391
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:42,601
And that started a whole series of moves

392
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,311
by other countries.

393
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,730
Australia,
New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore,

394
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,899
France, Germany, Italy,
UK, Ireland, Netherlands.

395
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,067
I could go on.

396
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,821
It does seem like
a bit of a rebuke of the FAA.

397
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,574
If an issue

398
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,579
that affects safety is identified,

399
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:07,125
the department and the FAA
will not hesitate

400
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,962
to take immediate and appropriate action.

401
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,633
To us,
to the families of the victims,

402
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,720
it was astounding
that the plane was still up in the air,

403
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,641
especially after two crashes.

404
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,977
We turn now to new developments
in the deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash.

405
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,562
With a cause still a mystery,

406
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,273
the black boxes
are being analyzed in France,

407
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,610
as new details emerge
about the flight's final moments.

408
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,988
We're getting
more information on the flight path,

409
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:41,034
and it's looking
very similar to the Lion Air crash.

410
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,998
And then in Ethiopia,
they found the jackscrew.

411
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,878
Jackscrew is this long screw,
about so thick,

412
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,714
that operates the stabilizer trim.

413
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:02,180
They found the jackscrew
in a full nose-down position.

414
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,350
Hands down, it was the MCAS.

415
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,019
Within 30 minutes,

416
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,854
President Trump is on television,

417
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,314
grounding the airplane.

418
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,693
I'm gonna be issuing
an emergency order of prohibition

419
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:20,532
to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8

420
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,868
and the 737 Max 9.

421
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,996
Any plane currently in the air
will go to its destination

422
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,458
and thereafter be grounded
until further notice.

423
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,175
To my knowledge, it's the only airplane

424
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,928
ever to be grounded
by the president of the United States.

425
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,057
But even after the Max was grounded,

426
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,018
and the planes had to be flown
to storage facilities,

427
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,648
we had pilots calling to say
they don't want to fly them there.

428
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:59,195
When a pilot doesn't want
to fly a brand-new Boeing,

429
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,781
that's an issue.

430
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,719
Two days after the second crash,

431
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,013
I started an investigation.

432
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,517
We knew something big was afoot here,

433
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,729
that this plane appeared
to be defective in some manner.

434
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,690
I had just hired my investigative staff,
and I said,

435
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,318
"Here's your first job, Boeing 737 Max."

436
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,240
In addition to Congress
trying to get to the bottom of this,

437
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:49,454
the families of the victims
really took this on as a personal issue.

438
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,501
They felt that there
needed to be some explanation

439
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:58,880
of how two planes could have crashed
within such a short period of time.

440
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,260
The crash families
started coming to DC

441
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:09,766
to help put pressure on Congress
to hold Boeing responsible.

442
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,853
Peter DeFazio, we're indebted to,

443
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,272
because he made this
the biggest investigation

444
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,567
in the history of the Transportation
Infrastructure Committee.

445
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,822
Paul Njoroge from Kenya lost his wife,

446
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,198
his three children,

447
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,325
and his mother-in-law.

448
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,411
I've been in touch
with the crash families,

449
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:33,915
and we definitely talk
about how to go about it

450
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,377
and understand what
has to be done to get justice.

451
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,423
This is who we've lost.

452
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,428
This is the cost
of doing business as usual.

453
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,726
I remember looking
at the full list of passenger names

454
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,438
from so many different countries.

455
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,441
People all over the world
have been impacted

456
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,985
by what has taken place.

457
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,041
We want this thing
to come out in the public.

458
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,169
We want Boeing to show all the papers.

459
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,255
We want them to come out
with the true facts.

460
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,552
When we started
the investigation,

461
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:31,639
a lot of people around the world
were angry and appalled

462
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,474
at what had been allowed to happen.

463
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,019
Do you feel your story is getting out?

464
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,355
I... right now it is
because we're having a hearing.

465
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,066
My concern is that weeks will pass,

466
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,278
and... and the FAA
will just put the plane back in the air

467
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,446
without any scrutiny.

468
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,281
They have the power to do that.

469
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,326
In the United States of America,

470
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,786
Congress has oversight duties,

471
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,871
plain and simple.

472
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:01,002
And the question was,
did Boeing put an unsafe plane in the air?

473
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,255
Meeting come to order.

474
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,717
We're here today in response
to two catastrophic crashes

475
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,055
that claimed 346 lives
in the span of five months.

476
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:16,476
We're very much in the beginning
of, uh, our investigation.

477
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,563
I would like to recognize
the family members of those killed,

478
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,649
uh, some of whom are here today,

479
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,818
and we're here to ensure
that the lives of your family members

480
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,905
were not lost, uh,
in vain and without response.

481
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:33,159
Today, we'll hear from pilots
and other safety professionals

482
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,078
who, uh, work on those planes.

483
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,414
Now, the question is,
what were the factors?

484
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:43,753
Congress's goal, of course,
was first to lay out for the public

485
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,713
what happened and why,

486
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,883
and secondly,
to look at legislative changes

487
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,135
that could prevent future crashes.

488
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,806
After the second crash occurred,

489
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:59,268
Boeing was trying to push
the focus onto the Ethiopian pilots.

490
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,231
They acknowledged that MCAS had misfired

491
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,359
but maintained that the Ethiopian crew

492
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:10,989
did not do everything precisely
as they were supposed to.

493
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,493
It was the same argument
they used with Lion Air,

494
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:20,957
and they waged a pretty vigorous
public relations campaign

495
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,001
to try to get their point across.

496
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:28,464
We learned that Boeing's lobbyists
were hiring firms in Washington

497
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:33,302
to spread the message
that foreign pilots were to blame.

498
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,223
Captain Carey, uh, Ethiopia Air,
the pilot in the right seat

499
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:39,976
could not fly at our standards here.

500
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:43,354
We need to look at
their pilot qualifications and training.

501
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:48,151
You know, Ethiopian Airlines flies a plane
into, uh, Washington Dulles every day

502
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,445
from Addis Ababa,
and they have been doing it for years.

503
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,613
They have a proud aviation culture,

504
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,117
and you have to remember,
uh, sir, and members of the panel,

505
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,995
this is a sudden violent
and terrifying event.

506
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:02,957
Captain Sullenberger,
is it fair to blame these pilots?

507
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,419
I just don't want to take the easy path
and blame... blame the pilots.

508
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,088
We shouldn't be blaming
the pilots,

509
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:13,926
and we shouldn't expect pilots
to have to compensate for flawed designs.

510
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,263
These crews would have been fighting
for their lives

511
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,557
in the fight of their lives.

512
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,865
<i>Soon after the hearings
got underway,</i>

513
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:40,328
<i>we managed to get more information
about what actually happened</i>

514
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:43,498
<i>in the cockpit of the Ethiopian aircraft.</i>

515
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,752
<i>We got the information from the FAA</i>

516
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:52,090
<i>within hours after they received it
from the Ethiopian investigators.</i>

517
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,843
<i>It was very late at night,</i>

518
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,263
<i>and we tried to put together
the most comprehensive story we could.</i>

519
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,811
<i>When it came out,</i>

520
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,397
<i>this was the first story that revealed</i>

521
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:13,194
<i>that the crew, in fact,
realized that MCAS had kicked off.</i>

522
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,156
<i>And they did
what Boeing instructed them to do.</i>

523
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,540
When the MCAS kicks in,

524
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,543
it runs for ten seconds

525
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,130
and pushes the airplane
very powerfully nose-down.

526
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,093
Runs for ten, off for five.

527
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,429
Runs for ten, off for five.

528
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,811
They've got
this cacophony of stick shaker,

529
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:50,231
master cautions,
airspeed disagree, altitude disagree.

530
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,984
All of these... these warnings going off.

531
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:58,739
The captain, who's flying the airplane,
is trying to figure out what's gone wrong.

532
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:05,037
The first officer called out,
"Stab trim cutout switches, Captain."

533
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,622
I think he said it twice.

534
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,666
He did what Boeing said.

535
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,502
He turned off the MCAS system.

536
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,840
I remember reading that,
and I said, "Man, the kid got it right."

537
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,092
"The kid got it right."

538
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:23,181
The problem now
is that the airplane is going too fast.

539
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,185
And because of the force
on the tail itself,

540
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,938
they cannot manually trim the airplane

541
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,523
to be able to recover.

542
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,703
<i>Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.</i>

543
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:18,361
The pilots in the first crash
had no inkling.

544
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:22,031
Their plane was behaving
completely differently

545
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:26,035
from the way that they had ever seen it,
and they didn't know what to do.

546
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,121
In the Ethiopian airplane,

547
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,541
it was a crew
that had been briefed by Boeing

548
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,877
on how this MCAS system worked.

549
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,880
And they did
what they were supposed to do.

550
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,258
They turned the system off,

551
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,177
and they still crashed.

552
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:48,599
For Boeing, this was a tremendous problem

553
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,395
and extremely damaging
to their reputation.

554
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:57,275
A reputation
that had been years in the making.

555
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,436
My father was
a fighter pilot in the Air Force

556
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,022
and an engineer at the Boeing Company.

557
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,608
Boeing was headquartered
here in the Pacific Northwest,

558
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,487
and far and away,
it was Seattle's biggest employer.

559
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,824
The Boeing pay was good,

560
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:51,370
so my father was able
to provide us a nice house

561
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:55,541
and, you know, put himself
square in the middle of the middle class.

562
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,628
Boeing was an engineering firm first,

563
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,840
and it had always been engineering-led.

564
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,219
By focusing on quality and innovation,

565
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:11,223
they created the products
that made Boeing part of America's pride

566
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,436
and had a tremendous impact
on the country's economy.

567
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:22,735
Boeing's signatures are on some
of the greatest technical advances made

568
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,737
during the 20th century.

569
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:29,450
Military airplanes,
unmanned vehicles, spacecraft,

570
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,620
and most notably,
commercial passenger jets,

571
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,791
starting in the late '50s with the 707.

572
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,045
That was followed by the 727

573
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,298
and then the workhorse
of the fleet, the 737.

574
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,885
There was just amazing engineering

575
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,553
that was coming out of Seattle.

576
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:54,183
Boeing's history of safety
and quality first

577
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:57,478
was something that the American public
came to understand.

578
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,524
People knew that if it's a Boeing plane,

579
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,900
they felt safe.

580
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,904
It was the dawn of the Jet Age,

581
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,156
and Boeing excelled at it.

582
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,203
They were cranking out
new modern airplanes one after the other.

583
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:20,209
And then, in the late '60s,
Boeing took an almost unimaginable risk.

584
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,356
<i>The mostest of everything</i>

585
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,006
<i>describes the new giant
of commercial aviation, the jetliner 747.</i>

586
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:31,846
<i>Contrasted with conventional aircraft,
the 747 will carry 490 passengers.</i>

587
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,433
<i>Its engines will be
twice as powerful as today's airliners.</i>

588
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,686
<i>The first of these great birds
will be delivered by the Boeing Company</i>

589
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,313
<i>to Pan American Airways in 1969.</i>

590
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:46,485
The 747 program was a moon shot.

591
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,657
Boeing bet on itself
to put together a fantastic airplane.

592
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:56,579
And they'd said it's gonna be the safest.
It's gonna be the most innovative.

593
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,247
It's gonna be the best.

594
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,210
The 747 revolutionized air travel.

595
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,839
For the very first time,
it became affordable

596
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,300
for people to travel internationally,

597
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,510
and it brought the world closer together.

598
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,265
The moon shots like the 747

599
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,976
are what put
the Boeing Company on the map.

600
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:24,315
It was, we're gonna do this at all cost.
Whatever it costs, we're gonna do it.

601
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,945
I worked
for the Boeing Company for 32 years.

602
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,990
It was a culture of mutual trust,

603
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:37,161
and we're in this together,
building a quality-engineered product

604
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,579
that makes us all proud.

605
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,748
- That looks good.
- Okay? Thank you.

606
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:47,296
When I was working for Boeing,
they came out with this team-wear for us,

607
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,757
and it had the Boeing logo on it.

608
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,385
You know, and at first, we're like,
"Pfft, you know, who wants team-wear?"

609
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:56,889
But it was amazing
when you actually put that shirt on,

610
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,307
and you go out in public.

611
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,436
And I can't tell you how many people
that were just, "Oh my God,

612
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,438
you work for Boeing. That is wonderful."

613
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,940
Looking good, Don.

614
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,150
And it really instilled
a lot of pride.

615
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:12,530
Perfect!

616
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,323
All right, all right. Good job, you guys!

617
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,926
- There it is, first one.
- First one.

618
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:22,081
I really loved working there
because I had a say.

619
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,791
And when something wasn't right,

620
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,710
I could bring it up,
and I wasn't afraid of being fired.

621
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,839
Boeing management
knew that safety came first,

622
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,801
and if we'd said, "Hey, it's not safe.
It's not ready to fly,"

623
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,052
we're... we're not going.

624
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:41,433
The culture back then
was we're all in this together,

625
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,852
and, you know,
Boeing's gonna look out for you,

626
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,480
and we expect you to look out for Boeing.

627
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,482
Now will you please join me
in welcoming

628
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:52,570
the 777 division vice president
and general manager, Alan Mulally.

629
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,614
So, good morning to you all.

630
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,910
There was a sense
of belonging and a sense of structure

631
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,079
and a sense of family.

632
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:03,956
We were a family.

633
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,125
We've come a long way together.

634
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,669
It was
an excellent company to work for.

635
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:16,176
And then, imagine coming into work,
and you got a whole new set of bosses,

636
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,722
and everything you've learned
in 30 years is now wrong.

637
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:23,267
Good evening, everyone.
It is a multibillion-dollar deal

638
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,103
that is sending shock waves
through the aerospace industry.

639
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,063
The planned merger
between the Boeing Company

640
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,273
and McDonnell Douglas.

641
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:33,527
The thought that was going through my head
as I walked up here was, "Wow."

642
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:39,366
I will serve as the chairman
and CEO of the company.

643
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,578
Harry Stonecipher will serve
as the president

644
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,372
and chief operating officer
of the company.

645
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,250
And our intention, like we expect

646
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,837
of everyone in the organization
is to work together.

647
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,798
And with that, I'd like
to introduce Harry Stonecipher. Harry.

648
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,301
Thank you, Phil.

649
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:58,636
Ladies and gentlemen...

650
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:03,557
The 1996 acquisition
of McDonnell Douglas by Boeing

651
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,769
was part and parcel
of what was happening across the country.

652
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,689
Merger, buyouts, consolidation.

653
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,402
That was the way companies viewed
their ability to stay competitive.

654
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,531
Boeing's place in the aviation industry

655
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:20,783
was preeminent.

656
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,159
They were the gold standard.

657
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:25,162
They were the people you looked up to
for their engineering excellence.

658
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:31,001
But that began to fall apart
when McDonnell Douglas and Boeing merged.

659
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:36,674
Harry Stonecipher
was the CEO of McDonnell Douglas,

660
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:40,511
and he ended up
the CEO of the Boeing Company.

661
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,055
So, pretty quickly,

662
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,350
McDonnell Douglas
became in charge at the very top.

663
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,021
This was following
on the heels of the 1980s

664
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,691
when cash was king on Wall Street.

665
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,193
You know, uh, "Greed is good."

666
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:03,992
When Harry Stonecipher took over,
he believed that the most important thing

667
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:07,162
was to take a company
and create value on Wall Street.

668
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,790
He said, "Hey,
we're in business to make money."

669
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:15,045
I want to hear about product and margin.
I want to hear that it's cost-effective.

670
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,465
The McDonnell Douglas leadership

671
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,801
took Boeing
in a more accelerated direction

672
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,470
toward being a financially driven company.

673
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,348
Wall Street demanded
its shareholder returns.

674
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:30,602
And they wanted Boeing
to act like a big industrial company

675
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,396
that delivered those returns.

676
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,400
Not long after the merger,

677
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,528
there was a major campaign launched

678
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,863
called ShareValue.

679
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:46,034
And the idea was that they wanted
everybody to be aware of the stock price,

680
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:50,414
and they wanted everybody working together
to increase the stock value.

681
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,709
Even the technical meetings,

682
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,712
everything revolved
around Boeing stock prices.

683
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,383
To turn around and see
the McDonnell Douglas executives

684
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,261
bringing their business plan
into the Boeing Company,

685
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,429
that upset a lot of us.

686
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,766
We knew back then
that that was a bad plan.

687
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:13,979
They drove the company as if it was
making washing machines, for instance.

688
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,564
Dishwashers.

689
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,777
All the airplanes had to be
manufactured more cheaply.

690
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,489
They were reducing
the number of people working,

691
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,949
expecting everyone to do more with less.

692
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:31,121
We saw the company
changing before our eyes.

693
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,127
You know, I'd been working there
in the Seattle area for a long time,

694
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,755
and the environment
that we ended up merging with

695
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,715
was so different.

696
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,802
McDonnell Douglas was
the good old boys' network.

697
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,264
They weren't respectful
of our processes for our employees.

698
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:55,437
And then we were told they were moving
the headquarters to Chicago.

699
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:58,148
<i>It is official.
Boeing is confirming that it's moving</i>

700
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,442
<i>its new international headquarters
to Chicago.</i>

701
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:04,863
And all of us that had been there
more than a week was like, "You're crazy."

702
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:10,327
Because back then, Boeing was Seattle,
and Seattle was Boeing. I mean they were...

703
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,162
They were lockstep.

704
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,540
We looked at all the data,

705
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:18,335
and we believe that Chicago
is the best choice for Boeing.

706
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,715
One of the arguments
for moving to Chicago

707
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:28,262
was to gain separation
from the technical people back in Seattle

708
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,474
so that executives
could make financial decisions

709
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:36,520
without as much pushback
from, um, engineers.

710
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,024
Before McDonnell Douglas,
we just didn't take shortcuts

711
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,402
'cause it just wasn't the Boeing culture.

712
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,485
No shortcuts.

713
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,738
You do it right,

714
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,032
and you build in
the quality and the safety,

715
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,409
and the profits will follow.

716
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,495
But all that changed,

717
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,873
and it was just heartbreaking.

718
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,878
I think we all tried
to appease ourselves by saying,

719
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,255
"Well, maybe we're just upset
because it's a change."

720
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:08,802
But in reality, our gut concerns
were really valid at the time.

721
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,639
That... that this was going to affect
the company in... in ways

722
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,850
that we couldn't... couldn't even imagine.

723
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,812
It's been a bad year for Boeing

724
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:22,065
and a better year
for its European competitor, Airbus.

725
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,527
For the year, Boeing has 368 new orders,

726
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,196
and Airbus has 427.

727
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,283
By the time that the merger
in 1997 happened,

728
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,495
the competition had just chipped away
at the market share

729
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,124
that Boeing had fought
to acquire over decades.

730
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:45,088
Boeing found themselves
in a very unusual position.

731
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,426
They were being challenged
by other manufacturers,

732
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:53,055
and that pressure was primarily coming
from the Europeans,

733
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,057
meaning Airbus.

734
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,644
Over the years,
there has been a lot

735
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,313
of bad blood between Boeing and Airbus.

736
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,982
But here's the thing about Airbus,

737
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,193
it didn't happen overnight

738
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,613
that it became
this incredible force in the industry.

739
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,824
It happened one little piece at a time.

740
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,911
It was a slow build,

741
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,996
little by little, little by little,

742
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,918
so that by 2003, Airbus ended up
overtaking Boeing's market share.

743
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,712
Boeing was behind.

744
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,422
Boeing needed to catch up.

745
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,886
So they started to push
even harder to get the airplanes out.

746
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:38,934
And over time, the laser focus
on safety that had been traditional

747
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,686
was compromised.

748
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:47,901
My job
at Boeing was quality manager.

749
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,259
If something's not right,
you need to find it and get it fixed

750
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,321
or get it corrected.

751
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:57,077
To ensure safety, finding things
was what you're supposed to do.

752
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:02,457
But instead of fixing problems,
everything was about speed.

753
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:06,920
Everything was about getting stuff done.
Let's move it. Let's get it done.

754
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,880
You can't stop. You can't slow down.

755
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,718
Used to be
when you raise your hand and say,

756
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,177
"We got a problem here,"

757
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,055
they would say,
"Yeah, you're right. We're gonna fix it."

758
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,641
After the merger with McDonnell Douglas

759
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,268
and the Airbus coming on,

760
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,937
Boeing quit listening to their employees.

761
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,482
So every time I'd raise my hand and say,
"Hey, we got a problem here,"

762
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,401
they would attack the messenger

763
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,362
and... and ignore the message.

764
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,575
Historically, Boeing was
a culture of telling bad news.

765
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,578
They discussed concerns freely
in building planes.

766
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,747
Now it became a problem

767
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,957
that you do not bring
bad news to the boss.

768
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,085
Boeing had highly-paid CEOs,

769
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,963
whose main incentive was
to increase the stock price

770
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,340
and to please Wall Street.

771
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:58,555
These CEOs demanded
that all their managers hit their marks,

772
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,348
and they don't care how they do that.

773
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,978
So I guess
to speed up production,

774
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:09,066
they got quality inspectors,
quality managers out of the picture.

775
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,444
A mechanic could speed up his job

776
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:17,449
by doing the work and then just saying
to the guy next to him, "Approve this

777
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,284
so that I can move on to the next spot."

778
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,912
Between me and you,

779
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:24,456
they didn't put a shim
on the landing gear yesterday.

780
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,875
On the lugs. Night shift didn't.

781
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,168
Oh, fuck.

782
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,588
They said we don't have time
to fucking put it on.

783
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,466
They have,
like, one quality person

784
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:37,344
for almost a whole building on each shift.

785
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,223
We used to have, you know, 15.

786
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,268
I was getting
complaints about debris.

787
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:50,232
Every day, we were finding crap
on airplanes that people were leaving.

788
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,901
There was drawings, tools,

789
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:54,736
fasteners.

790
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,280
There was this one 787,

791
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,199
and after a test flight,

792
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,577
they found a ladder
inside the horizontal stabilizer.

793
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,998
All it would have taken was that ladder
to fall up against the jackscrew assembly,

794
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,543
and that... that plane
would have been history.

795
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:16,800
These are pictures
of metal shavings in wire bundles.

796
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:21,638
These shavings can cause
a... a fire or a short.

797
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,142
And these aircraft fly by wire,

798
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,811
so if you have a... a short,

799
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,814
it could cause malfunctions
in your instruments,

800
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:34,901
in your landing gear. I mean, everything
that runs by wire would be affected.

801
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,156
Boeing whistleblowers have said

802
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:43,285
that anybody that reported
a problem at the South Carolina plant

803
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,452
was either fired

804
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,539
or let go or moved on.

805
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,170
My pay was docked
for putting quality concerns in writing.

806
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:57,966
They told us flat out they do not want
anything in documentation

807
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,677
so they can maintain culpable deniability.

808
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,014
They don't want anything documented.

809
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:19,779
There are a lot of questions
that still remain unanswered,

810
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,033
and Boeing has yet to provide
a single document.

811
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:27,287
I'm hoping they will provide
the documents we've requested voluntarily,

812
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,873
uh, and in the not-too-distant future.

813
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,001
From the start
of the investigation,

814
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:35,337
Boeing has been
very difficult to deal with

815
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,131
in terms of interviews and/or documents.

816
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,384
They have essentially ignored

817
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,261
the families of the victims.

818
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:49,226
Boeing has never reached out
to us directly.

819
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:54,648
It communicates their lack of remorse,
their lack of accountability.

820
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,025
And that's infuriating.

821
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,738
For them, it was business as usual.

822
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,867
But we're the ones
who were trying to make sure that

823
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:09,120
other families never have to deal
with what we're dealing with.

824
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:16,294
We've met with, I don't know,
55 congressmen and women and senators.

825
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,505
It's hard.

826
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:23,093
You go, and you relive this
55 times in a row

827
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:26,680
and talk about your daughter dying.

828
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,979
When we held up
pictures of our lost loved ones

829
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,148
in the hearing room, we were told,
"You're not supposed to do that."

830
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,192
"They're like protest signs."

831
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,737
And we said, "They're not protest signs."

832
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,864
"They're our loved ones."

833
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:52,372
I personally have probably been
at s... seven hearings.

834
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,875
Good afternoon. Thank you
for inviting me to testify today.

835
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,044
My name is Ed Pierson.

836
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:01,089
I believe production problems
at the Renton Factory

837
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:04,175
may have contributed
to these two tragic crashes.

838
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:09,097
I formally warned Boeing leadership
in writing on multiple occasions,

839
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,891
specifically once
before the Lion Air crash

840
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,227
and again
before the Ethiopian Airlines crash.

841
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,315
Those warnings were ignored. On June 9th...

842
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:23,111
We've heard
lots of testimony about the 737 Max,

843
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:27,699
but the committee wanted
actual documents from Boeing.

844
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,745
No documents had been received, nothing.

845
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,331
We fully expect
at a future hearing

846
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,957
to have Boeing into this committee,

847
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:39,419
uh, once we have, uh,
the documentation digested

848
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:43,673
that we need to ask the meaningful,
very pointed questions we will ask.

849
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:48,428
I was really frustrated. I thought
that Boeing was dragging its feet.

850
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:54,351
When will you talk to Boeing
as part of your ongoing investigation?

851
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:57,645
I really, uh, want to have
documents from Boeing

852
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:01,900
before I call them as a witness so we get
the meaningful information we want

853
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:04,319
and not just a pile of stuff this high.

854
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,530
Congress expected answers.

855
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:10,825
The families of the victims
expected answers.

856
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:17,040
But Boeing actively tried
to keep emails and documents

857
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:20,377
and internal memos
out of the public domain.

858
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:32,472
You know, they say aircraft crashes
are a combination of events

859
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,474
that all come together uniquely.

860
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,395
In this case, one of those events

861
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:41,189
was back when Boeing
lost its competitive edge.

862
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:45,151
These days,
Boeing finds itself facing turbulence

863
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,945
caused not by the weather

864
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:49,614
but by a foreign rival
with some very big ambitions.

865
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:54,077
<i>Airbus now leads the world
in building commercial airplanes,</i>

866
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,123
<i>a big stick in the eye to America
and to the Boeing Corporation.</i>

867
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:02,502
In the 2000s,
Airbus was on a roll.

868
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,381
They had several years
of selling more planes than Boeing.

869
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,466
And that raised eyebrows.

870
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,178
<i>In 1999,
Boeing delivered 620 planes.</i>

871
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,013
<i>Last year, 285.</i>

872
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,600
And then, in 2010,

873
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:21,354
Airbus introduced the A320neo.

874
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:30,864
For carriers, the ultimate goal,
of course, is maximum fuel efficiency.

875
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:36,202
A big part of an airline's cost
is what they paid for fuel.

876
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,039
Oil prices
had gone to record levels.

877
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,418
Airlines were saying, "We need
fuel efficiency, and we need it now."

878
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,462
And Airbus delivered.

879
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,839
The 320neo.

880
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,092
You scored an absolute home run

881
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:56,097
by making that decision to get out there
and offer it before Boeing.

882
00:57:56,181 --> 00:58:01,060
No airplane in aviation history
has ever sold so quickly and so well.

883
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:07,942
Back in Chicago, the neo
sent Boeing into a panic

884
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,069
because they didn't have
a plane ready to compete.

885
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,240
Boeing thought
about a new aircraft,

886
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,619
but the price tag
would have been significant.

887
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,039
And they didn't have the luxury

888
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:25,960
of taking seven, eight, ten years
to develop a brand-new plane.

889
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:33,051
So instead, they decided to put
more fuel-efficient engines

890
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,929
on the existing 737 model.

891
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:39,057
We are making a decision

892
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,976
to invest in the 737 family.

893
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,437
We are announcing the 737 Max.

894
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:49,651
The 737 Max gives our airline customers

895
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,611
the most efficient airplane

896
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:53,947
in the single-aisle segment.

897
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:58,660
We were disappointed.
We wanted a new airplane.

898
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:03,456
We really believed the 37 had...
was long in the tooth and had...

899
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,751
We had squeezed as much
as we possibly could from that airplane.

900
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,921
I mean, the design was over 40 years old.

901
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:19,556
The 737 had been flying
for more than four decades,

902
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:23,226
and different versions
of them had been developed.

903
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,062
A little bit better of an engine,

904
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,897
digital cockpits,

905
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,732
a little longer.

906
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:36,030
The 737 Max was seen
as a slightly updated,

907
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,783
more fuel-efficient version
of the same plane.

908
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,536
For a manufacturer,

909
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,955
the advantage of these derivatives,

910
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,456
as they're called,

911
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:49,877
was they required less time
to get approved by the FAA.

912
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,632
And the added benefit to the airlines

913
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,511
was you might not need
any additional pilot training.

914
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:02,640
Training pilots is
a major cost of operating an airline.

915
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:07,353
Despite how expensive the airplanes are,
it's the people that cost the most.

916
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,940
And training pilots
is a major piece of that pie.

917
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:16,779
If the Max turned out
to be too different from the existing 737,

918
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,699
that would have triggered immediately

919
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,492
an FAA red flag.

920
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:25,121
And simulator training
would be required fleet-wide

921
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,664
for all Max pilots.

922
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,502
We're talking about
devoted simulator training,

923
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,130
taking pilots off the flight line,

924
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,049
not having them fly passengers.

925
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,801
Getting them to come
into a training center

926
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:42,013
and sit for, whatever,
two days in a simulator.

927
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,017
So when Boeing
was designing the Max,

928
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,811
in order to remain competitive,

929
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,064
they made guarantees to the airlines

930
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:54,275
that their pilots
wouldn't need simulator training.

931
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:57,236
The strategy worked,

932
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,323
and the 737 Max sold phenomenally well.

933
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:04,702
Boeing got orders
for hundreds and hundreds of airplanes.

934
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:08,623
This is the largest firm order
that we've ever gotten,

935
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:12,585
in terms of number of airplanes
and also the value of this deal.

936
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,254
So, truly another historical day for us.

937
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,634
Boeing thought
that they could do this project

938
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,552
very quickly and very cheaply.

939
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,638
That it wouldn't take much effort.

940
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:26,474
They just thought
a little bit of tweak to the structure,

941
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:30,603
and you can stick an engine on there
and lengthen the landing gear,

942
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:31,979
and you're good to go.

943
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:38,069
And because there could be
no additional pilot training,

944
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,905
there was tons of motivation
within the company

945
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:44,867
to either build a design
that doesn't have significant differences

946
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,455
or potentially to cover up
a design that does.

947
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:15,648
We had to go through
very lengthy negotiations with Boeing

948
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,358
to receive documents.

949
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,987
We had engaged the House attorneys here,

950
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,698
and then we finally started getting

951
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:28,453
the first of the hundreds of thousands
of pages of documents that they gave us.

952
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,460
And my investigative staff

953
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:37,211
started going through it.

954
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:44,761
Virtually everything
was stamped "proprietary,"

955
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,097
and it took quite some time
to come to an agreement

956
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,851
so we could reveal
the contents of those documents.

957
01:02:54,645 --> 01:03:00,276
And I think the reason is
because they are so damning on their face.

958
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,988
In that massive tranche of documents,

959
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,532
one was particularly telling.

960
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:11,037
We found out
that a group of Boeing employees

961
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,666
had held a meeting
and discussed the MCAS system.

962
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:21,047
This memo, discovered
by the committee, and this is early on

963
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,715
in the development of the aircraft,

964
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:27,303
revealed that the MCAS system
was a problem for Boeing

965
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,805
from the very beginning.

966
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,974
Back in 2013,

967
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,186
when Boeing was just starting
to build the Max,

968
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:38,314
they were re-engining
a 45-year-old airframe

969
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,776
with these giant,
new fuel-efficient engines.

970
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,612
Because these engines are bigger,

971
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:49,158
they had to be positioned further forward
and higher up on the wings.

972
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:53,204
And so Boeing was worried about the plane

973
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:56,499
getting into, uh, too much of a nose-up,

974
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,252
and then the plane could stall.

975
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,089
So, if it starts to pitch up,

976
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:06,968
MCAS was designed
to help the pilot level the plane out.

977
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:13,558
The problem was
MCAS was a significant new system

978
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:18,187
and could prompt the FAA
to require some additional training.

979
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,858
So, what's the solution
in th... in this memo?

980
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:26,821
They said, "If we emphasize
MCAS is a new function,

981
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:30,867
there may be greater certification
and training impact."

982
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,454
Everybody at Boeing knew
you can't have pilot retraining.

983
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,082
No matter what we do,
no matter how we change this plane,

984
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:42,295
we've gotta pretend
it's the same plane as the predecessor.

985
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,090
So they decided,

986
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:50,720
"Externally, we would communicate
it is an addition to Speed Trim."

987
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:56,142
Speed Trim is the existing system,
which pilots had already been trained on.

988
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:01,022
"Internally continue using
the acronym MCAS."

989
01:05:02,648 --> 01:05:05,568
They determined
that they would conceal the existence

990
01:05:05,651 --> 01:05:09,614
to anybody, uh, outside
of Boeing of the MCAS system.

991
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:16,329
Once these documents
became public, it showed

992
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:20,458
that there were major, big issues
broiling under the surface

993
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:25,171
and a widespread pattern
inside Boeing of deceitful behavior.

994
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:32,094
This next piece of evidence was one
of the most important specific documents

995
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:35,765
relating to the design of the plane
and of the MCAS system.

996
01:05:37,099 --> 01:05:41,312
It shows that MCAS changed
over the course of the design.

997
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:46,442
Boeing didn't end up with the same system
that they started out with.

998
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,987
To begin with,
it became much more powerful.

999
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,910
It wasn't until Boeing got
into flight testing that they realized

1000
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:59,497
that they actually had to expand
how the MCAS system worked.

1001
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:03,542
They thought at first that it was
only gonna be for when the airplane

1002
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,877
was at high speeds.

1003
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:09,548
But what became clear
was that the Max needed MCAS

1004
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,718
when the airplane
was flying at low speeds as well.

1005
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,722
And it was this transition
to low-speed handling

1006
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,767
that made the system far more significant.

1007
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,397
The result was
is that MCAS gained more power.

1008
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:27,942
So it had the ability
to make larger movements

1009
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:29,527
of the horizontal stabilizer,

1010
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:33,531
which could push the nose
of the airplane down very quickly.

1011
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,372
In addition
to this increased power of the system,

1012
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:45,459
there was a second change,
something even more problematic.

1013
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:51,841
Boeing changed the MCAS system
to only use one sensor instead of two.

1014
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,472
It turns out
this way more powerful system

1015
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:02,351
was controlled
by just one angle-of-attack sensor.

1016
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,689
The MCAS system is safety-critical.

1017
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,693
And on an airplane, you never ever have

1018
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:15,614
a safety-critical system
that has a single point of failure.

1019
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,743
The angle-of-attack sensors

1020
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:22,788
protrude out of either side
of the fuselage, near the cockpit.

1021
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:26,834
If a happy-birthday Mylar balloon

1022
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:30,171
gets stuck on that vane,
it becomes unreliable.

1023
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:34,842
Believe it or not,
we hit balloons, we hit birds,

1024
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:39,722
uh, and all of these things,
uh, are not uncommon.

1025
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,727
If that sensor
is damaged or faulty,

1026
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,439
it will send a wrong message
to the MCAS system,

1027
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:51,776
which then tries to take over
the plane from the pilots.

1028
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:58,199
None of this
was communicated by anybody at Boeing

1029
01:07:58,282 --> 01:08:03,370
to the FAA engineer
who was in charge of oversight,

1030
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:05,748
and yeah, it should have been.

1031
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:08,709
The FAA
was kept out of the loop.

1032
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,462
Usually, there's a constant negotiation

1033
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:15,257
between... between a regulator
and the regulated

1034
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:17,843
about what parts of the airplane
are gonna change.

1035
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:21,430
But in the case of Boeing,

1036
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,641
they had a culture of concealment,

1037
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:28,312
deliberate concealment
regarding the MCAS system.

1038
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,274
And the evidence kept mounting.

1039
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:39,073
Coordination sheets
are technical documents

1040
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:41,867
written to archive information.

1041
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:48,833
This coord sheet
is capturing the history of MCAS.

1042
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:52,711
This is basically
about the safety issues

1043
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:55,005
that were analyzed inside Boeing,

1044
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:58,759
and the most relevant part of this dealt

1045
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:01,470
with how quickly pilots
would be able to react

1046
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,347
if the system went haywire.

1047
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:08,811
I haven't seen
this particular coord sheet before.

1048
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:10,812
Hmm.

1049
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:17,111
With pilot training
to recognize the runaway,

1050
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:20,739
a reaction time scenario
greater than ten seconds

1051
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:23,033
found the failure to be catastrophic.

1052
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,078
So if you don't respond

1053
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:30,541
in less than ten seconds
to this situation,

1054
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,418
you can't recover.

1055
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,295
Ten seconds,

1056
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:37,965
which is ridiculous.

1057
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:43,304
But the problem here
is not just the reaction time.

1058
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,515
The problem here is
the term "pilot training."

1059
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:51,896
It says, "With pilot training
to recognize the runaway,"

1060
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,858
they're saying
that we can't just throw pilots at this

1061
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:58,485
without awareness of the system.

1062
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:03,657
And... which... which that's
the real "gotcha" right in this statement.

1063
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:10,039
Pilots need to be trained on MCAS
to potentially avoid killing people.

1064
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,168
And Boeing knew that this was the case.

1065
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,963
And yet pilot training never happened.

1066
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:27,640
Our reporting and the memos
and documents that had been released

1067
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:31,352
revealed an underbelly,
an underside of the company.

1068
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:37,650
In this March 28, 2017,
internal Boeing communication,

1069
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:42,488
the chief technical pilot
for the 737 Max writes,

1070
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:45,407
"I want to stress
the importance of holding firm

1071
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:49,745
that there will not be
any type of simulator training required."

1072
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:53,624
"Boeing will not allow that to happen."

1073
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:59,046
"We'll go face-to-face with any regulator
who tries to make that a requirement."

1074
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:01,799
The tragedy of it is,

1075
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:05,552
some of these emails
were actually conversations with Lion Air.

1076
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:10,266
In a June 6, 2017 email exchange,

1077
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:12,977
which took place
the year before the crash,

1078
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:16,689
Lion Air says,
in effect, wouldn't it be better,

1079
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:19,900
wouldn't it be safer
to have some additional training?

1080
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:23,487
We want more
than you're... you're recommending.

1081
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:28,701
And Boeing writes, flat out,
"There is absolutely no reason

1082
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:31,787
to require a Max simulator
to begin flying the Max."

1083
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:37,293
If they had said
what the true power of MCAS was,

1084
01:11:38,043 --> 01:11:42,881
simulator training would be required
fleet-wide for all 737 Max pilots.

1085
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:47,219
Instead, Boeing literally mocked Lion Air,

1086
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,681
mocked them for wanting
to have simulator training.

1087
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:55,602
Boeing had to,
you know, berate them.

1088
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:59,606
"You cannot have simulator training."

1089
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,026
"You can't do it.
It costs money. We lose money."

1090
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:08,741
They talked about Jedi-mind tricking
regulators around the world

1091
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:14,705
into adopting the standard
of no simulator training required.

1092
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:19,835
So, we're supposed to react
in less than ten seconds

1093
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:24,131
to a system that's never been
on any airplane we've ever flown before.

1094
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:30,137
Boeing knew pilots had
a monster waiting for them

1095
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,430
in the MCAS system,

1096
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:35,768
but they conspire to <i>not</i> offer training.

1097
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,311
It's just

1098
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:40,689
unconscionable to me.

1099
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,816
It just...

1100
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:44,901
It's nuts.

1101
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:51,450
In the end, Boeing succeeded,

1102
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:55,329
and when the plane
was delivered to airlines,

1103
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:59,166
it didn't appear from the outside

1104
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:02,461
that there was something
fundamentally wrong with the aircraft.

1105
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:07,049
I mean, they were making sales
all over the world.

1106
01:13:11,303 --> 01:13:14,431
Boeing sold over 5,000 Maxes.

1107
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,517
It's an unbelievable number.

1108
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:21,146
It really was the product
that brought the financial performance

1109
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,358
on Wall Street up to a... a level
that Boeing had never seen before.

1110
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:27,319
Boeing's profit soared.

1111
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,697
The stock value went through the roof.

1112
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,242
And that was the whole idea.

1113
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:37,162
Performance was being judged
in quarterly returns,

1114
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:39,248
and the Max delivered.

1115
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:45,129
The 737 Max was going to be
the major meal ticket for Boeing

1116
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,380
for coming decades.

1117
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:49,258
This is a company
that, yeah, 500's a reasonable number.

1118
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:52,261
And it was seen as a sure thing.

1119
01:13:57,891 --> 01:14:00,561
Unprecedented value
for our customers,

1120
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:03,647
in terms of saving fuel,
in terms of being reliable,

1121
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:05,315
in terms of being maintainable.

1122
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:07,860
And you know what we've done?
We've created an airplane

1123
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:11,738
that's gonna exceed their expectations
by any way you measure it.

1124
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:16,785
Everyone thought
that the good times would never end.

1125
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:23,167
And then, in October of 2018, they did.

1126
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:34,678
The Lion Air pilots
not only didn't know

1127
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:36,305
how this system worked,

1128
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,765
they didn't know the name of the system.

1129
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:43,979
They didn't even know
that the MCAS system was on the aircraft.

1130
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:50,444
You just got the airplane
into the air, and all of a sudden, bang,

1131
01:14:50,527 --> 01:14:53,280
all these bells and warnings
and whistles and stick shaker going off.

1132
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:54,683
<i>Airspeed low.</i>

1133
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:59,411
An angle-of-attack sensor,
which had either failed or was damaged,

1134
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,456
was sending a bad input to the cockpit.

1135
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:04,917
It would have taken
more than a few seconds certainly

1136
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,920
for the pilots to determine
what the cause was.

1137
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:12,257
And then as soon
as the flaps were retracted,

1138
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,928
MCAS was activated.

1139
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,933
You started the clock, right?

1140
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:23,101
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,

1141
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,269
three Mississippi...

1142
01:15:27,272 --> 01:15:31,485
The way MCAS
kept pushing the nose of the airplane down

1143
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:32,903
was maniacal.

1144
01:15:32,986 --> 01:15:35,656
And the pilots never understood

1145
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:37,866
it was trying to kill them.

1146
01:15:38,659 --> 01:15:41,995
<i>Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.</i>

1147
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,375
You've got ten seconds,

1148
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,920
which is impossible.

1149
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,800
So basically, ten seconds, you're dead.

1150
01:15:58,178 --> 01:16:01,390
<i>Terrain. Terrain.
Pull up. Pull up.</i>

1151
01:16:20,325 --> 01:16:23,579
We now know
that within few days of the crash,

1152
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:25,622
Boeing knew what the problem was.

1153
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,875
They knew what he had faced,

1154
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:31,503
what my husband
had to go through in that flight.

1155
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:36,300
Boeing knew what the problems were
with MCAS.

1156
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:39,428
It's not that they were not aware of it.

1157
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:43,307
There should be a sense of responsibility.

1158
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:47,769
Here in the US,

1159
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:51,064
they never seriously considered
grounding the aircraft.

1160
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:54,109
After the first crash,

1161
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,445
Boeing was all about,

1162
01:16:56,528 --> 01:17:00,240
how can we justify
keeping the planes flying?

1163
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,788
We didn't know
at the time that after the Lion Air crash,

1164
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:10,500
the FAA had done a very technical analysis

1165
01:17:10,584 --> 01:17:11,585
called a TARAM.

1166
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,504
TARAM. T-A-R-A-M.

1167
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:18,050
A Transport Aircraft
Risk Assessment Methodology.

1168
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:22,512
They've projected
that there could be, without a fix,

1169
01:17:22,596 --> 01:17:24,681
15 more crashes

1170
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:27,267
of this aircraft during its life.

1171
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:34,441
They projected that
there could be as many as one fatal crash

1172
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:37,027
every two years of a Max.

1173
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:42,115
That would make the Max
the most dangerous modern jet ever built.

1174
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,872
At the time,
nobody heard about this report.

1175
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,500
It wasn't made public.

1176
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:57,297
But we verified
that Boeing knew about the results

1177
01:17:57,381 --> 01:18:00,300
at the same time
that the FAA knew about them.

1178
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:05,222
Boeing argued that it's never possible

1179
01:18:05,305 --> 01:18:08,475
to actually predict
the timing of another crash

1180
01:18:08,975 --> 01:18:12,396
and that they would have a software fix

1181
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:16,274
developed and tested
and implemented very quickly.

1182
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:21,405
And in the end,
the FAA accepted Boeing's argument.

1183
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:26,993
There were people, a few people,
at Boeing who rang alarm bells,

1184
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,537
but they were ignored.

1185
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,581
Up there in the executive offices,

1186
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:35,085
they were watching the stock price
and calculating their bonuses.

1187
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:39,673
Just six weeks
after the Lion Air crash,

1188
01:18:39,756 --> 01:18:43,051
the Boeing board decided
to increase stock buybacks

1189
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,386
and increase dividends.

1190
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,264
Total disregard for what happened.

1191
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:52,477
All of our customers are flying
all of their Maxes daily around the world.

1192
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:55,564
The airplane is safe,
and we're very confident in that.

1193
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,360
It's the corporate culture
that they had built up.

1194
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:01,778
It was their greed.

1195
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:06,450
Are the profits
more important than the human life?

1196
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:25,761
You know,
once they got the TARAM report,

1197
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:28,847
Boeing should have grounded the Max.

1198
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:31,433
They didn't do that.

1199
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:35,645
This was after the Lion Air crash,

1200
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,147
before my daughter died.

1201
01:19:38,648 --> 01:19:40,358
They let it go up in the air.

1202
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,739
I think
that is the most disturbing

1203
01:19:45,822 --> 01:19:48,366
and most revealing part
of the whole story.

1204
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:54,206
Boeing did the absolute least
that they could do

1205
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:58,001
to cope with this situation.
The absolute minimum.

1206
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:04,716
Basically, they were betting
that the problem would not reoccur

1207
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,511
before a permanent fix
could be implemented.

1208
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:12,307
And of course
that turned out to be a fatal mistake.

1209
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:18,480
It's just a horrible, horrible story.

1210
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:36,957
Boeing's failure
to do everything they could do

1211
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:41,044
to prevent the second crash
made our lives miserable.

1212
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:44,798
And this isn't just about Samya
and our family.

1213
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:47,676
It's about everybody
that died on those planes.

1214
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:52,764
And so, in October of 2019,

1215
01:20:52,848 --> 01:20:55,308
when Muilenburg was scheduled to testify

1216
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:56,726
at the Senate hearing,

1217
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:00,188
we were all highly motivated to be there.

1218
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:08,071
Muilenburg walks in,

1219
01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:09,197
and for a moment,

1220
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,117
he glanced at us, at the families,

1221
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:16,329
but he never really looked at us.

1222
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:30,218
A lot of the testimony that day was
about the internal Boeing communications.

1223
01:21:31,511 --> 01:21:33,889
You're the CEO. The buck stops with you.

1224
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:35,599
Did you read this document?

1225
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:40,979
And how did your team not run in
with their hair on fire,

1226
01:21:41,646 --> 01:21:43,940
saying, "We got a real problem here."

1227
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:48,820
Senator, when I was made aware
of the existence of this kind of document,

1228
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:52,157
I relied on our counsel to provide that
to the appropriate authorities.

1229
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:54,576
How did you not say,

1230
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:57,078
"We need to figure out
exactly what happened,

1231
01:21:57,662 --> 01:22:00,373
not after all the hearings,
not after the pressure,

1232
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:03,543
but because people have died
and we don't want another person to die."

1233
01:22:03,627 --> 01:22:06,838
Senator, as... as you mentioned, uh... uh,

1234
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:10,342
I didn't, uh, see the details
of this exchange until recently.

1235
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:14,387
Our family at that time
still had heard nothing from Boeing.

1236
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,308
We had heard Dennis Muilenburg

1237
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:21,728
apologize to cameras

1238
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:24,689
but never to us.

1239
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,943
We began work on an MCAS software update
in that time frame.

1240
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:31,571
When Senator Blumenthal's time
came to question,

1241
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:35,241
he asked the family members to stand up

1242
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:37,702
and hold their loved ones' pictures.

1243
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:41,748
To the relatives who have lost loved ones,

1244
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:44,000
if you could please stand.

1245
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:46,753
And at that point,

1246
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:51,049
Dennis Muilenburg had to turn around
and look at us.

1247
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:33,800
In the 21st century,

1248
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:38,013
to lose two planes
within months of each other

1249
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:39,723
and kill so many people,

1250
01:23:40,223 --> 01:23:42,934
it just never ever ever
should have happened.

1251
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:47,355
The safety culture at Boeing fell apart.

1252
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:50,650
It was corrupted from the top down

1253
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:53,194
by pressures from Wall Street,
plain and simple.

1254
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,488
Mr. Muilenburg,

1255
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:58,283
we have seen
that, you know, pressures from Wall Street

1256
01:23:58,366 --> 01:24:02,370
have a way of influencing the decisions
of the best companies in the worst way,

1257
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:05,999
endangering the public,
jeopardizing the good work

1258
01:24:06,082 --> 01:24:09,419
of countless, countless
hardworking employees

1259
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:10,920
on the factory lines.

1260
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:14,966
And I hope that's not the story
that is ultimately, uh, gonna be written

1261
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:18,011
about this long-admired company.

1262
01:24:33,943 --> 01:24:35,862
<i>I've thought
about this story a lot</i>

1263
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:39,157
<i>in terms of what it means
and what it will mean.</i>

1264
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:44,162
<i>Some of the mistakes
that Boeing made were irreparable.</i>

1265
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:49,876
<i>The people who died
and their families and their friends</i>

1266
01:24:49,959 --> 01:24:52,504
<i>and the lives that ended in tragedy,</i>

1267
01:24:53,004 --> 01:24:54,798
<i>those can never be repaired.</i>

1268
01:25:03,014 --> 01:25:05,016
<i>How many times
have you heard companies say,</i>

1269
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,559
<i>"We're committed to excellence."</i>

1270
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:10,188
<i>"We're committed to safety.
We're committed to our customers."</i>

1271
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:14,651
<i>But no matter how big the company is
and how sophisticated</i>

1272
01:25:14,734 --> 01:25:18,696
<i>and what a fantastic past it had,
which is all true for Boeing,</i>

1273
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:20,740
<i>we should be skeptical.</i>

1274
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:24,953
<i>All of us should be skeptical.</i>

1275
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:44,347
The Boeing 737 Max planes
now back in the air.

1276
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:46,826
Flight happening today
for the first time in nearly two years

1277
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,290
after the planes, they were grounded

1278
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:51,521
following two fatal crashes
that killed hundreds of people.

1279
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:54,149
Yesterday, we spoke
exclusively with Dave Calhoun,

1280
01:25:54,232 --> 01:25:56,484
the president and CEO of Boeing.

1281
01:25:56,568 --> 01:26:00,655
We don't want to hide anything
because we're proud of what we do.

1282
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:04,200
The products that we make are incredible.
They're good for humanity.

1283
01:26:04,284 --> 01:26:07,579
And I'm very proud of our team,
and I'm very proud of that airplane.

1284
01:26:07,662 --> 01:26:09,789
It is a, uh, remarkable machine

1285
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:12,292
and as safe
as anything... anything in the air.
