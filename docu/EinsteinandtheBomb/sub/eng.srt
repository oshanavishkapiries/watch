1
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,291
<i>The first atomic bomb
heralded the dawn of a troubling new era.</i>

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,796
<i>In a single stroke, the Japanese city
of Hiroshima and some 70,000 men,</i>

3
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,007
<i>women, and children were annihilated.</i>

4
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,720
<i>In the years since, that momentous event
has come under increasing scrutiny.</i>

5
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,851
<i>Was the bomb
a price worth paying for pea...</i>

6
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:20,830
<i>The physicists who participated
in forging the most formidable</i>

7
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,500
<i>and dangerous weapon of all time</i>

8
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:27,587
<i>are harassed
by an equal feeling of responsibility,</i>

9
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,506
<i>not to say guilt.</i>

10
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:39,015
<i>Dr. Albert Einstein,
one of the world's greatest scientists.</i>

11
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:44,145
<i>A scientific giant who sometimes
generated political controversy,</i>

12
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,814
<i>as well as brilliant equations.</i>

13
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,441
<i>Called the father of the atomic age,</i>

14
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,693
<i>Einstein's great contribution
to human knowledge</i>

15
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,071
<i>was his theory of relativity.</i>

16
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,658
<i>The key to the atom secrets was
first given to the world when the genius,</i>

17
00:01:56,741 --> 00:02:00,328
<i>Albert Einstein, defined the relation
between all matter and energy.</i>

18
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,666
<i>E is equal to MC squared.</i>

19
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,001
<i>Had I known</i>

20
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,755
<i>that the Germans would not succeed
in producing an atomic bomb,</i>

21
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,469
<i>I would not have taken part
in opening that Pandora's box.</i>

22
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,325
Hail to victory!

23
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,459
<i>Order! Motion under the ten-minute rule,</i>

24
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,546
<i>bill to promote and extend
opportunities of citizenship for Jews</i>

25
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,090
<i>resident outside the British Empire.</i>

26
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,719
<i>- Commander Locker-Lampson.</i>
- <i>Thank you, Mr. Speaker.</i>

27
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,140
<i>I am not personally a Jew,</i>

28
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,478
<i>but I hope
that I do not require to be a Jew</i>

29
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,981
<i>to hate tyranny anywhere in the world.</i>

30
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,778
<i>Germany has selected
the cream of her culture</i>

31
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,655
<i>and suppressed it.</i>

32
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,451
<i>She has even turned upon
her most glorious citizen.</i>

33
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,036
<i>Einstein.</i>

34
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:12,252
<i>The road hog and racketeer of Europe
have plundered his place.</i>

35
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,170
<i>They've even taken away his violin.</i>

36
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,050
<i>Today, Einstein is without a home.</i>

37
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,470
<i>He had to write his name
in a visitor's book in England.</i>

38
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,100
<i>And when he came to write his address,
he put...</i>

39
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,227
<i>"Without any."</i>

40
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,906
Here we are, Professor.

41
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,784
Welcome to Roughton Heath.

42
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,036
Isn't it wonderful?

43
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,915
Let's get you settled in, eh?

44
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,896
I know it's rudimentary
for a man of your importance

45
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,733
but, under your current circumstances...

46
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,236
I believe that a simple
and unassuming life

47
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,114
is best for body and mind.

48
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,407
Couldn't agree more.

49
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,618
What I like best is a tent on a heath,

50
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,331
plain viands, a glass of beer,

51
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:35,793
and the sweet communion of... friends.

52
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,674
For you.

53
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,512
To replace the one the Hun stole from you.

54
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,767
I'll let you unpack in peace.

55
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,492
<i>The present state of affairs in Germany</i>

56
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:11,079
<i>is a state of psychic distemper
in the masses.</i>

57
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,293
<i>Hitler picked up human flotsam
on the streets and in the taverns</i>

58
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,171
<i>and organized them around himself.</i>

59
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,300
<i>The worst outcrop of herd life,</i>

60
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:27,178
<i>the military system, which I abhor.</i>

61
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,394
<i>German fascism
has been particularly violent</i>

62
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,230
<i>in its attack upon my Jewish brothers.</i>

63
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,898
BE CAREFUL. JEWS.

64
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,316
I AM THE BIGGEST PIG IN TOWN

65
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,449
<i>Our friends in Germany
need not do anything to protect me.</i>

66
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,122
<i>In fact, such action
would needlessly endanger them.</i>

67
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,134
<i>I cannot tell you yet,
whether I shall make England my home.</i>

68
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,051
How is he?

69
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,431
As you'd imagine.

70
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,976
Poor fellow's lost everything,
his home, his money.

71
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:19,272
And now, I hear the Nazis have placed
a price of 20,000 marks on his head.

72
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:23,151
I really had no idea
that my head was worth all that.

73
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,821
I assure you, Professor.

74
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,450
You're perfectly safe
from the long arm of fascism here.

75
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,621
Uh, may I introduce Barbara Goodall.

76
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,623
Hello, Professor.

77
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,208
And Margery Howard.

78
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,334
Hello, Professor.

79
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,086
Delighted.

80
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,338
These ladies are your bodyguards.

81
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:49,635
If any unauthorized person comes near,
believe me, Professor...

82
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,055
They will most certainly get
a charge or two of buckshot.

83
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,642
Sorry, Professor,
I know you're not one for bearing arms,

84
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,686
but really we can't be too careful.

85
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,022
Hope you understand?

86
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,901
Marvelous.

87
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,779
Keep a close eye out, ladies.
I'm relying on you both.

88
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,214
<i>A precious possession
in this world, however,</i>

89
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,299
is one's own people

90
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:34,263
<i>and we want to lead</i>

91
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,391
<i>and fight for these people.</i>

92
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:43,940
And never flag, never tire, never despair.

93
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,943
<i>As long as I have
any choice in the matter...</i>

94
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,155
<i>...I shall live only in a country
where civil liberty,</i>

95
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:55,618
<i>tolerance, and equality
of all citizens before the law prevail.</i>

96
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,960
<i>These conditions do not exist
in Germany at the present time.</i>

97
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:09,882
<i>This breeding ground of disease
will soon pose a grave danger</i>

98
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,759
<i>for the rest of the world.</i>

99
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,844
We have one aim,

100
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:19,225
and we will follow it fanatically
and ruthlessly to the grave.

101
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,769
Hail to victory!

102
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,745
<i>To stay in Germany</i>

103
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,650
<i>would have been impossible for me
as a pacifist.</i>

104
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,906
<i>I'm not only a pacifist,
but a militant pacifist.</i>

105
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,160
<i>I am willing to fight for peace.</i>

106
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,167
My great friend has invited me here.

107
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,714
I can live quietly,
working out my mathematical problems.

108
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,009
All I want is peace,

109
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,762
and could I have found
a more peaceful retreat

110
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,556
than here in England?

111
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,350
No one will know where I am.

112
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,561
Indeed not!

113
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,438
Shall we get some pictures?

114
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,371
The Observer <i>diary,
17th September 1933.</i>

115
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,751
<i>England is not
a very good place to hide in.</i>

116
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,339
<i>Dr. Einstein, who has come here
to escape Nazi persecution,</i>

117
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,467
<i>finds his wooden hut
photographed in the papers</i>

118
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,303
<i>with full indications of locality,</i>

119
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,724
<i>and Cromer Council considers
the question of presenting an address.</i>

120
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,812
<i>Germany, I suppose,
is presumed to be looking the other way.</i>

121
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:58,491
When did you start thinking about time
and space and all those things, Professor?

122
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,041
Ah!

123
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,005
As a child of four or five,

124
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,760
my father showed me a compass.

125
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,640
This experience made
a deep and lasting impression on me.

126
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:28,771
That this needle behaved
in such a determined way.

127
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,150
Something deeply hidden
had to be behind things.

128
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,987
When I was four or five,

129
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,532
I couldn't tie my own shoelaces.

130
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,454
The most beautiful thing we can experience

131
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,873
is the mysterious.

132
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:03,347
<i>I can still remember
my first childish experiments in thinking</i>

133
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:07,351
<i>that had a direct bearing
on the theory of relativity.</i>

134
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,566
<i>What if one were to run
after a ray of light?</i>

135
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,613
<i>If one were to run fast enough,</i>

136
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,283
<i>would it no longer move at all?</i>

137
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,346
Of course, such a thing is impossible.

138
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,808
- Your teachers must have loved you.

139
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,270
"You'll never amount to anything,
Einstein."

140
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:55,274
"You're an extremely clever boy,
but you have one great fault."

141
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,610
"You'll never let yourself
be told anything."

142
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,405
"Your mere presence spoils
the respect in the class for me."

143
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,951
The teachers had
the characters of drill sergeants.

144
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,164
Mistrust of every kind of authority grew.

145
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,001
An attitude that has never again left me.

146
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,385
<i>It is only men who are free,</i>

147
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:28,265
<i>who create the inventions
and intellectual works,</i>

148
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,142
<i>which make life worthwhile.</i>

149
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,773
<i>Out yonder there was this huge world,</i>

150
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,276
<i>which stands before us
like a great, eternal riddle.</i>

151
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,079
<i>I became convinced
that nature could be understood</i>

152
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,290
<i>as a relatively simple
mathematical structure.</i>

153
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,838
<i>A storm broke loose in my mind.</i>

154
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,593
<i>Einstein's great theory of relativity.</i>

155
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,930
<i>Two towers flash signals at the same time</i>

156
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,182
<i>to a balloonist
and to a man on the ground.</i>

157
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,187
<i>The observer on the ground says
the signals were given from both towers</i>

158
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,730
<i>at the same time.</i>

159
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,986
<i>Light rays from both towers
are the same length.</i>

160
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:29,243
<i>But the motion of the balloonist means
one signal takes more time to reach him</i>

161
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,746
<i>and he insists that one tower signaled
before the other.</i>

162
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,211
<i>My solution actually had to do
with the concept of time.</i>

163
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,257
<i>Two observers moving at different speeds</i>

164
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,177
<i>experience time at different rates.</i>

165
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,016
<i>Time cannot be absolutely defined.</i>

166
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:59,064
<i>Time is relative.
It stretches and shrinks.</i>

167
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,234
<i>Or, in our Earth language, an hour for us</i>

168
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,487
<i>may be a century on another planet,</i>

169
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,156
<i>and vice versa.</i>

170
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,455
<i>There is no audible ticktock
everywhere in the world.</i>

171
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,924
Past, present, and future
is only an illusion.

172
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,261
But one more consequence
also occurred to me.

173
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,556
According to the theory of relativity,

174
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:38,270
there is no essential distinction
between mass and energy.

175
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:45,110
Energy is put equal to mass

176
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:50,240
multiplied by
the square of the velocity of light.

177
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,827
So, a very small amount of mass

178
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,415
may be converted
into a very large amount of energy.

179
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:16,392
<i>Kind fate allowed me
to find a couple of nice ideas</i>

180
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,727
<i>after years of feverish labor.</i>

181
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,270
Mr. Einstein.

182
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,821
Einstein! Einstein! Einstein!

183
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,790
Professor Einstein.
Professor.

184
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,625
Professor.

185
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,835
Professor Einstein.

186
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,460
<i>Times of London.</i>

187
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,423
Um, you have caused a revolution
in science,

188
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:50,134
and Newtonian ideas are overthrown.

189
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,344
<i>New York Times.</i> Our headline today,

190
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,388
"Lights all askew in the heavens!"

191
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,306
"Men of science more or less agog!"

192
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,976
"Einstein's theory triumphs!"
How do you feel?

193
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,062
My faculties have been quite overrated.

194
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,984
Professor, could you possibly
explain your theory to the man<i>,</i>

195
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,361
or possibly the woman, in the street?

196
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,700
An hour sitting with a pretty girl
on a park bench passes like a minute,

197
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:18,454
but a minute sitting on a hot stove
seems like an hour.

198
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,913
That's relativity.

199
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,375
Very funny. Very funny indeed.

200
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:33,594
<i>Like the man in the fairy tale
who turned everything into gold,</i>

201
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,889
<i>so with me,</i>

202
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,601
<i>everything is turned
into newspaper clamor.</i>

203
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,953
<i>To punish me for my contempt of authority,</i>

204
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,832
<i>fate made me an authority myself.</i>

205
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,425
It turned out that the inertia of a system

206
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,678
necessarily depends on its energy content,

207
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:21,850
and this led straight to the notion
that inert mass is simply latent energy.

208
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:28,649
Mass and energy are both different
manifestations of the same thing.

209
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,193
So, a small amount of mass

210
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,404
may be converted
into a very large amount of energy.

211
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,619
Sorry, Professor,
but are you saying it could be possible

212
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,996
to, well, somehow release that energy?

213
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:48,585
Science in its present state
makes it appear almost impossible

214
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,796
that we should ever succeed in so doing.

215
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,716
It would be like, uh,
shooting birds in the dark

216
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,469
in a country
where there are very few birds.

217
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:02,349
Still, energy released on that scale
sounds... rather worrying.

218
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:07,729
Concern for man himself and his fate
must always be the chief objective,

219
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,108
in order that the creations of our minds

220
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,986
should be a blessing
and not a curse to mankind.

221
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,201
Stand down, ladies!

222
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,997
I'm expecting someone. Friend, not foe.

223
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,128
I think you'll very much enjoy meeting
this gentleman, Professor.

224
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,599
Been spending some more time
chatting with the professor, Margery?

225
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,227
- Oh, listening mainly.

226
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,564
He's been explaining the finer points
of his theory of relativity to us.

227
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,148
And?

228
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,818
And I'm quite certain
that he understands it.

229
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,372
Epstein.

230
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,959
No, no. Einstein.

231
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,547
Professor, this is Jacob Epstein.
The sculptor.

232
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,799
Oh!

233
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:22,346
Professor, I'm very interested
in your head.

234
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,494
I understand you're none too popular
in Germany, Professor.

235
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,378
I read recently that 100 Nazi professors
have condemned your theories as incorrect.

236
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,592
Were I wrong, one professor
would have been quite enough.

237
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,264
I thought I was a physicist.

238
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,268
I did not bother being a non-Aryan

239
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,395
until Hitler made me conscious of it.

240
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,636
<i>Only those of German blood,</i>

241
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,014
<i>whatever their creed,
may be members of the Nation.</i>

242
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,891
<i>All non-German immigration
must be prevented.</i>

243
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,853
<i>No Jew may be a member of the Nation.</i>

244
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,772
<i>Leaders of the party promise
to work ruthlessly,</i>

245
00:21:56,481 --> 00:22:01,111
<i>if need be, to sacrifice their very life
to translate this program into action.</i>

246
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,173
At present, every coachman
and every waiter is debating

247
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,508
whether relativity theory is correct.

248
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:28,472
Here is yet another application
of the principle of relativity

249
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,557
for the delectation of the reader.

250
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,770
Today, you are described in Germany
as a "German savant,"

251
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,272
and in England as a "Swiss Jew."

252
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:43,028
Should it ever be my fate
to be represented as a bête noire,

253
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,948
I should, on the contrary,
become a "Swiss Jew" for the Germans

254
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,242
and the "German savant" for the English.

255
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,791
"This event has been organized

256
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,252
by the 'Working Society
of German Scientists

257
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,713
for the Preservation of Pure Science.'"

258
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,715
Their conviction is determined

259
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,967
by the political party
to which they belong.

260
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,098
"First speaker, Paul Weyland."

261
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,903
Our theme this evening,

262
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,366
to protect the German people
from being misled

263
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,119
by highly acclaimed scientists,

264
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,663
who set
the scientifically-interested world

265
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,083
in disarray with half-baked opinions.

266
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,253
He doesn't seem to be an expert at all.

267
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,172
Doctor? Engineer? Politician?

268
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,387
We present observations
on Einstein's theory of relativity

269
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,306
and the manner of its introduction.

270
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,147
Rarely in science

271
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,150
has a postulated scientific system

272
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:08,530
been promoted as extravagantly
as the general principle of relativity,

273
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,241
which at a closer glance,

274
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:15,245
is revealed
to be severely lacking in proof.

275
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:21,751
Einstein engages in a businesslike
booming of his theory and his name.

276
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,919
In short,

277
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,926
Einstein's theory of relativity
is nothing less than scientific Dadaism.

278
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:38,143
It is the product
of an intellectually-confused time,

279
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,644
and plagiarized to boot.

280
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,856
It is, in fact, a hoax

281
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,901
promoted by the clique
of his academic supporters.

282
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,696
All of this is
a consequence of the intellectual

283
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,575
and moral decay of German society,

284
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,912
which is being exploited and promoted

285
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,706
by a certain press.

286
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:36,785
<i>My answer to the
Anti-Relativity Theory Company Limited.</i>

287
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,333
<i>I have reason to believe</i>

288
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:47,128
<i>that motives
other than the striving for truth</i>

289
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,006
<i>are at the bottom of this enterprise.</i>

290
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,345
<i>Were I a German nationalist,</i>

291
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,681
<i>whether bearing a swastika or not,</i>

292
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,685
<i>rather than a Jew
of liberal international bent...</i>

293
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,772
<i>I am neither a German citizen</i>

294
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,942
<i>nor do I believe in a Jewish faith.</i>

295
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,571
<i>But I am a Jew,</i>

296
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,824
<i>and I am glad
to belong to the Jewish people.</i>

297
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,374
Professor,

298
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,210
do you think you might put out your pipe?

299
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,506
I would rather view the individual

300
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,844
in a fog and semi-darkness
than in the light.

301
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,764
It's just I can barely see you
through the smoke.

302
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,447
Gentlemen. Shall we?

303
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,647
<i>Someone to see you, Professor.</i>

304
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,690
Walter Adams.

305
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,860
I think you should listen
to what he has to say.

306
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,866
Uh, Professor, I'm here
in my role as secretary

307
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,035
of the Academic Assistance Council.

308
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,122
We formed earlier this year
with the explicit intention

309
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,793
of helping displaced academics
who might need to flee Germany

310
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:53,588
in light of the, um...
current appalling circumstances

311
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,964
for Jews there.

312
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:00,220
I have been promoted
to an evil monster in Germany,

313
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,682
and all my money
has been taken away from me.

314
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,183
Yes, I'm so sorry.

315
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:10,188
Professor, we're organizing an event
in support of academic refugees

316
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:14,567
and, uh... well, we wonder
whether you would agree to speak?

317
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:17,903
Mr. Adams,

318
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,450
if I were to appear in public

319
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,412
as a prosecutor of the German government,

320
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,249
it would have terrifying consequences
for the German Jews.

321
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,628
Yes, perhaps.

322
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,716
But the circumstances
are already terrifying for them

323
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,467
even without your intervention.

324
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:46,057
Professor, you are
the most renowned physicist of the age.

325
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:50,729
Your voice would echo around the world
and help to reveal the scale

326
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,939
of the Jewish academic purge in Germany.

327
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,402
I assure you,
it will only be a modest meeting

328
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,989
where a small number
of well-known people will speak.

329
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,706
Would you at least consider it?

330
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:49,996
<i>Few Germans were alert to the threat
that Hitler and the Nazis posed.</i>

331
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,208
<i>A failed coup attempt
did little to dispel their image</i>

332
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,294
<i>as a tin pot army of political no-hopers.</i>

333
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,130
<i>Yet, in the wake of World War I,</i>

334
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,675
<i>Hitler courted
the many disillusioned team of soldiers</i>

335
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,429
<i>to swell the party's ranks
and set him on the road to power.</i>

336
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,187
<i>Humanity is suffering in Germany.</i>

337
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:19,275
<i>The present wave of nationalism
is a severe sickness.</i>

338
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,324
<i>It takes but the slightest provocation,</i>

339
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,202
<i>or at times no provocation at all,</i>

340
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,663
<i>to be transformed into chauvinism.</i>

341
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,938
<i>My feelings for Rathenau
were ones of thanks</i>

342
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:02,235
<i>for the hope and consolation he gave me
during Europe's presently bleak situation.</i>

343
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,365
<i>He was the first victim
of Nazi propaganda.</i>

344
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,091
Professor,
just a few questions.

345
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:17,000
Professor, there are rumors
you are not returning to Germany.

346
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:26,509
In view of the attitude that large numbers
of educated Germans have towards Jews,

347
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:31,264
I have been warned against making
any kind of public appearances in Germany.

348
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,726
For I am supposedly
among the group of people

349
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,478
being targeted by nationalist assassins.

350
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:41,357
But you deny you are fleeing Germany?

351
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:46,946
I am going to Japan because that means
12 weeks of peace on the open sea.

352
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:54,203
<i>I am glad to just disappear
for six months.</i>

353
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,623
<i>The voyage is wonderful,</i>

354
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,834
<i>even though Japan is quite exhausting.</i>

355
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:08,009
<i>Here, I have already given 13 lectures</i>

356
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,678
<i>and been photographed
for the 10,000th time.</i>

357
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,433
<i>No living person deserves
this sort of reception.</i>

358
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,276
<i>An enthralling walk along the coast.</i>

359
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,988
In the afternoon,
a tour to the peak of the mountain.

360
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,809
<i>In Berlin and throughout Germany,</i>

361
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,769
<i>people are suffering from hunger,</i>

362
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,397
<i>an absence
of the bare necessities of life.</i>

363
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,066
<i>Unemployment and mounting inflation</i>

364
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,151
<i>are bringing the country
to the edge of ruin.</i>

365
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,737
<i>Money means almost nothing.</i>

366
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,740
<i>300 billion marks
for a half-pound of apples,</i>

367
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,201
<i>and the mark's value continues to fall</i>

368
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,328
<i>lower and lower.</i>

369
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,249
<i>The middle class is wiped out.</i>

370
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,712
<i>The Reichsbank works overtime
printing more and more paper money</i>

371
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,630
<i>that buys less and less.</i>

372
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,759
<i>The Nazi ranks now begin to swell,</i>

373
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:36,597
<i>aimless, jobless young men
fed on promises of power and gold.</i>

374
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,769
<i>The Berlin adherents of the Nazi party</i>

375
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,187
<i>spent yesterday at Nuremberg</i>

376
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:47,233
<i>and formed part of a body of 12,000,
mostly Bavarians,</i>

377
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,527
<i>who paraded before the famous Hitler.</i>

378
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,763
<i>The globe-trotting
Professor Einstein arrives back</i>

379
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,290
<i>in New York
to be met by a mob of reporters.</i>

380
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,918
The greatest scientist of Germany

381
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,504
in the greatest city of the world.

382
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,922
I'm delighted.

383
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,343
<i>The reporters asked
exquisitely inane questions,</i>

384
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,346
<i>to which I replied with cheap jokes.</i>

385
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,349
What do you think
of prohibition, Professor?

386
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,977
I don't drink, so I couldn't care less.

387
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,755
<i>Germany and election day,</i>

388
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,656
<i>Herr Hitler stuns the world
as his vote soars.</i>

389
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,659
<i>Now, 6 million of his countrymen
back the Nazis,</i>

390
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,871
<i>making them
the second-largest party in the Reichstag.</i>

391
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:46,167
<i>Is there no stopping
the self-styled Führer's onward march?</i>

392
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,258
<i>Professor Einstein suddenly became grave</i>

393
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:58,930
<i>and almost vehement when asked about
the Nazi party's recent election success.</i>

394
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,225
<i>"I do not enjoy
Mr. Hitler's acquaintance," he said.</i>

395
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:07,021
<i>"Hitler is living
on the empty stomach of Germany."</i>

396
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,982
<i>"As soon as economic conditions
in Germany improve,</i>

397
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,526
<i>he will cease to be important."</i>

398
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:16,489
<i>Beyond this statement,
Dr. Einstein would not discuss politics.</i>

399
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,535
The struggle between the people

400
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,161
and the hatred amongst them

401
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,791
is being nurtured
by very specific interested parties.

402
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:32,004
It is a small,
rootless, international clique

403
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,257
that is turning people against each other.

404
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:39,595
They are the only ones who can really
be regarded as international elements

405
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,559
because they conduct
their business everywhere.

406
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,854
Einstein!

407
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:55,278
<i>Mere words do not get pacifists anywhere.</i>

408
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,072
<i>They must initiate action.</i>

409
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,242
<i>Deeds are needed.</i>

410
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:07,373
<i>Even if only 2% of those
supposed to perform military service</i>

411
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:10,293
<i>should declare themselves
war resisters and assert,</i>

412
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,836
<i>"We are not going to fight,"</i>

413
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,964
<i>the governments would be powerless.</i>

414
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,778
<i>More than one million Jews
throughout the United States</i>

415
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:23,055
<i>will join protest meetings today
against the persecution of Jews</i>

416
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,808
<i>in Germany by the Hitler government.</i>

417
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,566
<i>Brownshirts are marching in triumph,</i>

418
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,485
<i>for Adolf Hitler rules Germany at last.</i>

419
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,739
<i>Great crowds assembled
when the announcement came</i>

420
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,240
<i>that Hitler had accepted command.</i>

421
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,867
<i>What now,</i>

422
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:47,538
<i>for 50 million Germans
give allegiance to the Hitler flag,</i>

423
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,248
<i>the famous swastika.</i>

424
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,711
On this evening, I call on our people

425
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,213
every hour

426
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,343
of every day

427
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:06,140
to think only of Germany, the Reich,

428
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,851
and our German nation,

429
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,728
our German people.

430
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:16,025
Hail to victory!

431
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,050
<i>In Pasadena,</i>

432
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,618
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Albert Einstein
bid friends farewell.</i>

433
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,248
<i>The professor has spent
the best part of a decade</i>

434
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,042
<i>darting between his homeland
and the rest of the world.</i>

435
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,879
<i>But the Germany
he's returning to this time</i>

436
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,298
<i>is a far cry from the one he left.</i>

437
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,301
<i>Now, Herr Hitler reigns supreme.</i>

438
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,889
<i>Germany was a land of devilry by night.</i>

439
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,645
<i>That in which you did not believe
must be destroyed.</i>

440
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,022
<i>And in the burning,</i>

441
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,067
<i>liberty, tolerance, and gentleness</i>

442
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,361
<i>vanished from the land.</i>

443
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,434
German men and women.

444
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:11,998
The age of an exaggerated
Jewish intellectualism

445
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,457
has now come to an end.

446
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,671
<i>The Einsteins'
transatlantic voyage is rudely interrupted</i>

447
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,632
<i>with the news that
their summer home has been raided.</i>

448
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,720
<i>My summer home has often in the past</i>

449
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,306
<i>been honored by the presence of guests.</i>

450
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,725
<i>They were always welcome.</i>

451
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,186
<i>No one had any reason to break in.</i>

452
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:40,818
<i>These acts are the result
of a rabid mob of the Nazi militia.</i>

453
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:46,657
<i>I think it is quite possible
that the political circus at home</i>

454
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,992
<i>will go on for some time,</i>

455
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,120
<i>and that I will not return.</i>

456
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,813
<i>What is the real attitude
of the new German dictator?</i>

457
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,923
<i>Is it Hitler's plan
to continue to maintain Germany</i>

458
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,092
<i>under his National Socialist rule,</i>

459
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,179
<i>or does he plan to restore
a semblance of the former monarchy</i>

460
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,848
<i>with himself
as the power behind the throne?</i>

461
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,142
<i>Whatever Hitler's plans may be,</i>

462
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,478
<i>it is certain
that in his scheme of things,</i>

463
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:19,565
<i>no one but himself will be allowed
to play the principal role.</i>

464
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,153
There is Professor's picture.

465
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,241
"Was greatly honored by the Jewish press

466
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:32,036
and the unsuspecting German people."

467
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,419
"Showed his gratitude

468
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:44,256
by lying atrocity propaganda
against Adolf Hitler."

469
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,597
And below that, it says...

470
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,182
It says...

471
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,020
It says...

472
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,689
"Not yet hanged."

473
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,821
When I was young,

474
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:12,576
all I wanted from life
was to sit quietly in a corner somewhere,

475
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,455
doing my work
without the public paying attention to me.

476
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,500
Now look what has become of me.

477
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,295
I'm so very sorry, Professor.

478
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:28,676
I cannot understand the passive response
of the whole civilized world

479
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,719
to this modern barbarism.

480
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,514
Doesn't the world see
that Hitler is aiming for war?

481
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,267
It would seem not.

482
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,190
This must be difficult for you.

483
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,485
I mean, as a committed pacifist.

484
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:51,365
Yes, but I have little need to tell you
that I am an unconditional anti-fascist.

485
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,911
The entire German population
is being poisoned with nationalism

486
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,329
and drilled for war.

487
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,625
I loathe all armies.

488
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,211
And any kind of violence.

489
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,590
Yet, I am firmly convinced
that in the present state of the world,

490
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:12,261
organized force can be opposed
only by organized force.

491
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,185
There is no other way.

492
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,648
No other way.

493
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:50,799
<i>The world is in greater peril from those
who tolerate or encourage evil</i>

494
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,886
<i>than from those who actually commit it.</i>

495
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,558
Silence would have made me
feel guilty of complicity.

496
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,026
<i>Einstein will speak. Stop.</i>

497
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,613
Forget the "modest meeting."

498
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,324
You want to raise money
to help the German Jews, don't you?

499
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,242
Stop.

500
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,410
Leave the venue to me. Stop.

501
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,580
I've already booked a bigger hall.

502
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,748
You have?

503
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,502
The biggest.

504
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,589
Locker-Lampson. Stop.

505
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,135
To Walter Adams. Urgent delivery.

00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,057
<i>We venture to put it to Dr. Einstein</i>

518
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,185
<i>that he would be wise
to stop this injudicious agitation</i>

519
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,731
<i>in this country against the Nazi regime.</i>

520
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,638
The first thing is my gratitude

521
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,641
as a man...

522
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,353
as a good European...

523
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,690
as a Jew.

524
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,513
I've just spoken to Mr. Adams.

525
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,682
Every ticket has been sold.

526
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,269
Ten thousand people.

527
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,149
You've got the speech prepared?

528
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,493
Proud of you.

529
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,999
The car's ready. Ready when you are.

530
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,894
Ladies and gentlemen, Professor Einstein.

531
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:44,533
"I am glad you have given me
the opportunity...

532
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,784
an opportunity..."

533
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:49,621
"I am glad you have given me
the opportunity...

534
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,752
...of expressing to you here

535
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:58,881
my deep sense of gratitude as a man,

536
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,508
as a good European,

537
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,760
and as a Jew."

538
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,851
"It cannot be my task

539
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:15,522
to sit in judgment
over the conduct of a nation

540
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:19,610
which for many years
counted me among its citizens."

541
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,281
"It is perhaps futile

542
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,952
even to try to evaluate
its policies at a time

543
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:32,372
when it is so necessary to act."

544
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,335
"The crucial questions today are

545
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,798
how can we save mankind

546
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,674
and its cultural heritage?"

547
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,762
"How can we guard Europe

548
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,306
from further disaster?"

549
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,686
"Discontent breeds hatred."

550
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,899
"And hatred leads to acts of violence,

551
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,943
revolution,

552
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,026
and even war."

553
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:06,156
"Thus, we see how distress

554
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,952
and evil beget new distress and evil."

555
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:15,457
"If we are to resist
the powers that threaten

556
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,126
intellectual and individual freedom,

557
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:24,716
we must be very conscious of the fact
that freedom itself is at stake."

558
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:31,223
"We must realize
how much we owe to that freedom

559
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,685
which our forefathers won
through bitter struggle."

560
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,564
"Without such freedom,

561
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,860
there would have been no Shakespeare,

562
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,361
no Goethe,

563
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:45,696
no Newton,

564
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,197
no Faraday,

565
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,532
no Pasteur,

566
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:49,867
and no Lister."

567
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,251
<i>Should we merely lament the fact</i>

568
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,963
<i>that we live in a time of tension,
danger, and want?</i>

569
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,882
<i>I think not.</i>

570
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,844
<i>Only when subjected
to peril and social upheaval,</i>

571
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:13,307
<i>do nations feel induced
to adopt progressive measures.</i>

572
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:20,022
<i>One can only hope that the present crisis
will lead to a better world.</i>

573
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,610
<i>One can only hope</i>

574
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,740
that the present crisis
will lead to a better world.

575
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,011
The Institute will be located in Princeton

576
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,642
and will begin in the fall of 1933,
the School of Mathematics

577
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,145
<i>headed by Professor Einstein.</i>

578
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,820
<i>I found Princeton lovely.</i>

579
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,905
<i>A wondrous little spot.</i>

580
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:56,410
<i>I consider that we are
extraordinarily fortunate</i>

581
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:01,289
in being able to begin
with a man like Professor Einstein,

582
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:06,837
<i>who is one
of the ranking scientists of all time.</i>

583
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,008
<i>Into this small university town,</i>

584
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:15,345
<i>the chaotic voices of human strife
barely penetrate.</i>

585
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,726
<i>I am almost ashamed
to be living in such a place</i>

586
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,812
<i>whilst all the rest struggle and suffer.</i>

587
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,320
<i>Hitler continues to arm,</i>

588
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:37,034
<i>while suppressing the rights of all
whose ideas do not agree with his.</i>

589
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,746
<i>Jews, Catholics, liberals, Protestants,</i>

590
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,458
<i>and women who, under his regime,
have been reduced to medieval slavery,</i>

591
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,336
<i>all stand aghast
as the threat of war again appears.</i>

592
00:50:56,261 --> 00:51:00,015
<i>When asked why
I have given up my position in Germany,</i>

593
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,975
<i>I made this statement.</i>

594
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,312
<i>As long as I have any choice,</i>

595
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,106
<i>I will only stay in a country</i>

596
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:12,319
<i>where political liberty,
toleration, and equality is the rule.</i>

597
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:16,114
<i>I do feel that in America,</i>

598
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,493
<i>the most valuable thing in life
is possible.</i>

599
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,371
<i>The development of the individual
and his creative power.</i>

600
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,460
<i>The night of the broken glass.</i>

601
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:33,423
<i>Two hundred synagogues
and 7,500 shops are put to the torch.</i>

602
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:37,135
<i>Ninety Jews are murdered,
hundreds injured,</i>

603
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,346
<i>thousands demeaned and spat upon.</i>

604
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,305
BE CAREFUL, JEWS

605
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:43,850
<i>26,000 Jewish men are arrested
and sent to concentration camps.</i>

606
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,357
<i>The visible destruction
matches the violence</i>

607
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,736
<i>that has been done
Germany's 250,000 remaining Jews.</i>

608
00:51:54,820 --> 00:52:00,659
<i>And never flag, never tire, never despair...</i>

609
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,637
<i>Desperate and destitute,</i>

610
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,122
<i>they are pushed to the edge of existence.</i>

611
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,666
<i>Long live the German people...</i>

612
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,644
<i>Germany has turned down</i>

613
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,795
<i>a dark and sinister path</i>

614
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,463
<i>from which there is no return.</i>

615
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,975
<i>Scientists at George Washington University</i>

616
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:27,477
<i>heard a report of startling significance.</i>

617
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,313
Word has just come through from Germany

618
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,567
that uranium atom,
under neutron bombardment,

619
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,652
actually splits into two parts.

620
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,588
<i>To the scientists,</i>

621
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:41,158
<i>this dramatic news
brought a great sense of urgency.</i>

622
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,787
<i>A very small amount of mass</i>

623
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:50,625
may be converted
into a very large amount of energy.

624
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,632
<i>Military intelligence fear</i>

625
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:02,345
<i>that Hitler may have already taken
the first steps toward an atomic bomb.</i>

626
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:08,602
Energy released on that scale
sounds... rather worrying.

627
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:12,022
Science in its present state
makes it appear almost impossible

628
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,608
that we should ever succeed in so doing.

629
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,342
<i>Conscious of the disaster,
which would inevitably follow</i>

630
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:27,454
<i>if Nazi Germany should be the first
to succeed in releasing atomic energy,</i>

631
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,957
<i>Dr. Einstein decided to write
a personal letter to the president</i>

632
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,211
<i>and stressed the urgent need for action
by the US government.</i>

633
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,128
<i>Sir,</i>

634
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:40,926
<i>some recent work,
which has been communicated to me,</i>

635
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,512
<i>leads me to expect
that the element uranium</i>

636
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:48,975
<i>may be turned into a new
and important source of energy.</i>

637
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:54,564
<i>This new phenomena would also lead
to the construction of bombs,</i>

638
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:58,485
<i>extremely powerful bombs of a new type.</i>

639
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,364
<i>In view of this situation,</i>

640
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:06,868
<i>you may think it desirable
to speed up the experimental work,</i>

641
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,329
<i>which is at present being carried on.</i>

642
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:13,124
<i>Yours, very truly, A. Einstein.</i>

643
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:22,467
Organized force can be opposed
only by organized force.

644
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,519
<i>Nazi troops have invaded Poland</i>

645
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:36,189
<i>by land and by air in undeclared war.</i>

646
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,462
<i>Hitler's war machine
sweeps through Europe,</i>

647
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,363
<i>conquering the old enemy France.</i>

648
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:47,492
<i>We shall break up and derange
every effort which Hitler makes.</i>

649
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:52,122
<i>We shall strive to resist him
by land and sea.</i>

650
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:56,376
<i>He will find no peace, no rest, no parley.</i>

651
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,880
Mr. Churchill may be convinced

652
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,298
that Great Britain will win.

653
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:04,676
I doubt not for a second
that Germany will be the victor.

654
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,947
<i>With the fall of Belgium,</i>

655
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,516
<i>her stockpiles
of the nuclear material uranium</i>

656
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,268
<i>are seized by the Nazis.</i>

657
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,567
<i>Pearl Harbor,</i>

658
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,695
<i>our great Pacific outpost
in the Hawaiian islands,</i>

659
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:27,741
<i>is ruthlessly bombed
as Japan's perfidious declaration of war.</i>

660
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,161
<i>No matter how long it may take us,</i>

661
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,581
<i>the American people
in their righteous might</i>

662
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,626
will win through to absolute victory.

663
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:56,102
E is equal MC squared.

664
00:55:56,811 --> 00:56:00,565
The basic formula that unlocked
the secrets of the atom.

665
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:16,247
<i>It is important
that we be vividly aware</i>

666
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:19,000
<i>of the mass murders
which the Germans have committed</i>

667
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:22,754
<i>against the civilian populations
of the occupied countries.</i>

668
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,385
<i>The Germans are intent everywhere</i>

669
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:33,765
<i>on exterminating those which represent
a nation's independent spirit.</i>

670
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:42,816
<i>In Norway,</i>

671
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:47,153
<i>Allied Forces deliver a devastating blow
to the Nazi nuclear program.</i>

672
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,324
<i>A series of raids
on a hydroelectric power plant</i>

673
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:54,369
<i>cuts off their source
to vital chemical supplies.</i>

674
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:05,672
<i>D-Day. Over 150,000 troops,
carried by more than 5,000 vessels.</i>

675
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,758
<i>The largest amphibious invasion
in history.</i>

676
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,886
<i>The tide of the war is turning on Germany.</i>

677
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:24,107
<i>Allied Forces recover
a cache of secret Nazi files</i>

678
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:27,152
<i>that show that their atomic weapon program</i>

679
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,236
<i>has failed.</i>

680
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:48,047
<i>As the Allies advance
deeper into the European mainland,</i>

681
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:51,301
<i>the true horror
of Hitler's plan is revealed.</i>

682
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,513
<i>Pictorial evidence
of the almost unprecedented crimes</i>

683
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:58,975
<i>perpetrated by the Nazis
at the Buchenwald concentration camp.</i>

684
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,104
<i>These bones were men, women, and children</i>

685
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,440
<i>sent to be exterminated.</i>

686
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:14,282
<i>The crime of the Germans
is truly the most abominable ever</i>

687
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:18,036
<i>to be recorded in the history
of so-called civilized nations.</i>

688
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,806
<i>In the official report,</i>

689
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:23,666
<i>the Buchenwald Camp is termed
an extermination factory.</i>

690
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,136
<i>They elected Hitler</i>

691
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,306
<i>after he made
his shameful intentions clear</i>

692
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,684
<i>beyond the possibility
of misunderstanding.</i>

693
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,436
Hail to victory!

694
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,280
<i>Since they massacred my Jewish brethren,</i>

695
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,408
<i>I will have nothing further to do
with Germans.</i>

696
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,459
<i>April 1945.</i>

697
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:11,798
<i>The Soviet Army launches
its final assault on Hitler's forces,</i>

698
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:16,135
<i>encircling Berlin
and closing in on the Führer's bunker.</i>

699
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,604
<i>Hopelessly defeated,
Hitler takes his own life</i>

700
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,690
<i>with a single gunshot to the head.</i>

701
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,782
<i>The war in Europe is won,</i>

702
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:41,452
<i>but US-led forces continue
their search for a decisive end</i>

703
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,037
<i>to the war with Japan.</i>

704
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:48,459
- <i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

705
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,755
<i>After years of scientific endeavor,</i>

706
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,134
<i>the Manhattan Project
has delivered an atomic bomb.</i>

707
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,269
<i>Alamogordo in the New Mexico desert.</i>

708
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,770
<i>The first atomic test.</i>

709
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,482
<i>It's a terrifying prelude
to the onslaught that awaits</i>

710
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,527
<i>the unsuspecting citizens of Hiroshima.</i>

711
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,491
<i>Height approximately 32,000 feet.</i>

712
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:25,622
<i>Course, 265 degrees magnetic.
Air speed, 250 knots.</i>

713
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,000
<i>Am approaching target area.</i>

714
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:32,003
<i>Cloud cover less than three-tens
at all altitudes.</i>

715
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:34,172
<i>Immediate target area clear.</i>

716
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,510
<i>A short time ago,</i>

717
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:25,306
an American airplane
dropped one bomb on Hiroshima.

718
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,978
<i>What has been done
is the greatest achievement</i>

719
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:33,606
<i>of organized science in history.</i>

720
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:06,055
<i>The first atomic bomb heralded
the dawn of a troubling new era.</i>

721
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,182
<i>In a single stroke,</i>

722
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:12,937
<i>the Japanese city of Hiroshima
and some 70,000 men, women, and children</i>

723
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,021
<i>were annihilated.</i>

724
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:16,524
<i>In the years since,</i>

725
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:19,902
<i>that momentous event
has come under increasing scrutiny.</i>

726
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,824
<i>Was the bomb a price
worth paying for peace?</i>

727
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,052
My dear Professor.

728
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:53,561
At present,
the Japanese people are keenly conscious

729
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,272
of their own responsibility
for the last war.

730
01:02:56,814 --> 01:03:00,902
And are showing
sincere repentance for their crime.

731
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:20,004
Recently, years since
the termination of the war,

732
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,800
the Japanese people
have come for the first time

733
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,636
face-to-face with the annihilating effects

734
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,262
of an atomic bomb.

735
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,268
And now, we ask you, Professor Einstein,

736
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:36,103
why science,

737
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:40,107
whose primary aim is but to serve
the welfare and happiness of mankind,

738
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:44,654
should have been instrumental
in producing such horrible results?

739
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:50,993
I do not consider myself the father
of the release of atomic energy.

740
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,287
My part in it was quite indirect.

741
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:56,749
In view of the fact
that <i>you</i> played an important role

742
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,918
in the production of the atomic bombs?

743
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:02,547
My sole contribution was that in 1905,

744
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:06,884
I established the relationship
between mass and energy.

745
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:14,225
I believed only that atomic energy
was theoretically possible.

746
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:20,940
I did not, in fact,
foresee that atomic energy

747
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,942
would be released in my time.

748
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:51,095
I made one great mistake in my life.

749
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:56,726
When I signed that letter
to President Roosevelt.

750
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:08,613
The likelihood that the Germans
were working on the same problem

751
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:14,076
with every prospect of success
forced me to take this step.

752
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,431
<i>Had I known
that the Germans would not succeed</i>

753
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,976
<i>in producing an atomic bomb,</i>

754
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:25,815
<i>I would not have taken part
in opening that Pandora's box.</i>

755
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:33,823
I never would have lifted a finger.

756
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:50,089
<i>Before the raid on Hiroshima,</i>

757
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:53,467
<i>leading physicists
urged the War Department</i>

758
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:58,097
<i>not to use the bomb
against defenseless women and children.</i>

759
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:06,272
<i>Had we shown other nations
the test explosion of New Mexico,</i>

760
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,901
<i>we could have used it
to make proposals for world order.</i>

761
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,278
<i>To</i> end <i>war.</i>

762
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,035
<i>The physicists who participated in forging</i>

763
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:23,789
<i>the most formidable
and dangerous weapon of all time</i>

764
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:27,752
<i>are harassed
by an equal feeling of responsibility,</i>

765
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:29,795
<i>not to say guilt.</i>

766
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:37,720
<i>We delivered this weapon into the hands
of the Americans and the British people</i>

767
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,557
<i>as trustees of the whole mankind,</i>

768
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,185
<i>as fighters for peace and liberty.</i>

769
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,646
<i>But so far,</i>

770
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,608
<i>we fail to see any guarantee of peace</i>

771
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:55,404
<i>or the freedoms
that were promised to the nations.</i>

772
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:08,000
The situation calls
for a courageous effort.

773
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:14,799
For a radical change in our whole attitude

774
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:18,219
in the entire political concept.

775
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:21,846
Otherwise,

776
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:25,226
human civilization will be doomed.

777
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,187
The war is won.

778
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,689
The peace is not.

779
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:40,592
<i>President Truman's dramatic announcement</i>

780
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:43,119
<i>that Russia has created
an atomic explosion</i>

781
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:45,454
<i>sends reporters racing
for Flushing Meadow,</i>

782
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,499
<i>where Russia's Vyshinsky
arrives to address the United Nations.</i>

783
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,501
Mr. Vyshinsky, have you got any statement...

784
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:54,130
- Please, excuse me.
- Does Russia have the atomic bomb?

785
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,594
<i>A crack, a blast.</i>

786
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:03,430
<i>The release of deadly radioactive rain.</i>

787
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:07,935
<i>And in a matter of seconds,
downtown New York would be a massive ruin.</i>

788
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,899
Our country is at war.

789
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:18,028
A war declared against us
by the rulers of international communism.

790
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:20,698
<i>This constitutes
the greatest crisis</i>

791
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:22,449
<i>in the history of America.</i>

792
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:26,704
<i>There are signs
that the Kremlin is already intensifying</i>

793
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:28,581
<i>its use of another weapon.</i>

794
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:30,624
<i>Communist propaganda.</i>

795
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:35,629
<i>We are in the midst
of a continuing struggle</i>

796
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,506
<i>for the minds of men.</i>

797
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:44,513
The German calamity
of years ago repeats itself.

798
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,809
People act fierce without resistance

799
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,771
and align themselves
with the forces of evil.

800
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:57,443
How long should we tolerate politicians

801
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:03,449
hungry for power or trying to gain
political advantage in such a way?

802
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:10,956
<i>It is strange that science,
which in the old days seemed harmless,</i>

803
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:14,877
<i>should have evolved into a nightmare
that causes everyone to tremble.</i>

804
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,843
<i>One thing I have learned in a long life</i>

805
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:27,598
<i>is that all our science
measured against reality is childlike.</i>

806
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:35,105
<i>And yet,
it is the most precious thing we have.</i>

807
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:50,329
<i>Science is not,
and never will be, a closed book.</i>

808
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:55,960
<i>Every important advance
brings new questions.</i>

809
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:01,006
<i>But the years
of anxious searching in the dark</i>

810
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,842
<i>and the final emergence into the light,</i>

811
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:09,431
<i>only those who have experienced it
can understand.</i>

812
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:14,019
<i>We must not condemn man</i>

813
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,855
<i>because his conquest
of the forces of nature</i>

814
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,858
<i>are being exploited
for destructive purposes.</i>

815
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,112
<i>Rather, the fate of mankind</i>

816
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:28,242
<i>hinges entirely upon
man's moral development.</i>

817
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,477
<i>Dear posterity,</i>

818
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,189
<i>if you have not become more just</i>

819
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:44,735
<i>or peaceful and generally more rational</i>

820
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:46,612
<i>than we are or were,</i>

821
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,740
<i>then may the devil take you.</i>

822
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:53,994
<i>I am, or was,</i>

823
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:57,873
<i>your Albert Einstein.</i>
